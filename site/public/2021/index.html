        <p><p>I just finished reading <a href="https://psychsciencenotes.blogspot.com/2021/11/is-direct-perception-plausible.html">Andrew Wilson’s series of blog posts</a> on the foundation of ‘ecological psychology’ This post started as a comment but it was too long for the comment field (and at 1800 words, that’s not a surprise), so I’m posting it here. It is a bit rough and in places, it expects, that you know what the original posts say. I added some quotes for context but the original posts are still worth a read. But even on its own, I think this post lays out the argument for the need of a more robust psychological account of the human experience.</p></p>

        <p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This post originally <a href="https://medium.com/metaphor-hacker/history-as-weather-a-fractal-theory-of-history-for-ian-morris-jared-diamond-and-cgp-grey-45b5503486c5">appeared on Medium</a> in 2016. This a very lightly revised version with new formatting for <a href="https://metaphorhacker.net/2021/01/the-nonsense-of-style-academic-writing-should-be-scrupulous-not-stylish/">ease of readability</a>. It preceded the post on <a href="https://metaphorhacker.net/2019/09/so-you-think-you-have-a-historical-analogy-revisionist-history-and-anthropology-reading-list/">historical revisionism</a> and <a href="https://metaphorhacker.net/2020/02/its-not-personal-its-family/">anthropology of family</a> but it tackles and elaborates on some of the same themes.</p>
<h2 id="outline-of-the-argument">Outline of the argument</h2>
<p><strong>History is often accused of not being sufficiently scientific</strong>. To remedy this people try to come up with all sorts of theories of history that try to look like science. They come up with some measurable variable (e.g. availability of domesticable species as Jared Diamond did or energy output as Ian Morris did or size of population, advancement of technology, size of armies, etc. as many others do). This, they hope, explains the past and predicts the future.</p></p>

        <p><p>I became a feminist because a woman once told me not to be an idiot and I decided that it was good advice. That was in 1998. But I was all ready to be a feminist long before that, so it really just took a small push to get me over the hump. I was always surrounded by strong women who outshone the men around them, read books as a boy with girls holding their own, later on had women friends who I could respect and like more than most of my male friends.</p></p>

        <p><h2 id="the-problem-with-writing-advice">The problem with writing advice</h2>
<p>The problem with the likes of Steven Pinker and Helen Sword is that they like their own writing way too much. But I don’t. Like their writing, that is. [1] I want to get some information from them and I want to get examples and counterexamples for the points they make. I want them to get to the point. I am not reading them for enjoyment, that’s what fiction is for. I am reading them to learn what they have to say and I have to wade through a morass of stories, pointless metaphors, geysers of words. They are aiming for eloquence but effluence would be a better term for what their reader gets.</p></p>

        <time>2021-01-01</time>
        
        <p><p>On rereading Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, I was struck by this passage in his foreword to the second edition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse ‘applicability’ with ‘allegory’; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author. <a href="http://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__the_lord_of_the_rings_1__en.htm#00">http://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__the_lord_of_the_rings_1__en.htm</a></p></p>
