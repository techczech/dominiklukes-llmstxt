<h2 id="the-state-of-digital-dislocation">The state of digital dislocation</h2>
<p>The current state of digital dislocation is forcing us to reevaluate what is the essence of teaching and learning. The “grammar of schooling” [1] has been taken away from us and we are forced to learn a new dialect by immersion with just a few phrasebooks, hastily pulled off the shelf, to guide us. Digital teaching is still teaching but it is teaching with an accent, one where we’re still trying to acquire enough fluency and idiomaticity to feel completely at home. When we add to it the culture shock of being in a new situation without any of the familiar cues, sights, sounds and smells of our native environment, it is not surprising that many people are feeling stressed and long for a swift return to “normal”. But it is also no surprise that many others are examining the current situation and finding the new land to be one of endless opportunity and thinking of establishing a permanent residence or at least buying a holiday home.</p></p>

<p>I organised my first video lecture in 2002 when I was teaching in Glasgow and wanted students to get access to experts from London and Prague. It required a dedicated room and a technician on both ends, yet it seemed that an explosion of online teaching was just around the corner. But when I started a public lecture webinar series in 2010, online presentations were still a rarity. Now, webinars and virtual meetings are commonplace but we’re still not seeing a lot of entire events moving online. Even during the time of global lockdown and mass event cancelations, most events are simply cancelled even as teaching, meetings and music concerts move online. Why is that?</p></p>

<p>Fully online events are not very common but they exist. Many people have written about some of their experiences that we can learn from. Being more aware of the affordance mismatch between online and physical events can help us make the most of these tips and augment them.</p>
<h3 id="tips-for-organisers">Tips for organisers</h3>
<h4 id="initial-considerations">Initial considerations</h4>
<ol>
<li>Think about the format of the event. Does it have to be just a day or two or can you split a day into a week or two worth of sessions? A more concentrated event can develop more of a feel of unity but may be more intensive to organise and harder to attend for people who join from their place of work.</li>
<li>Think about whether you want the event to be synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous events put much lower demands on presenters and will also have more engagement. People are more likely to attend an hour-long live event than watch the same length video recording. Successful asynchronous events require more intensive moderation with a time commitment for organisers that may span weeks.</li>
<li>Think about the formats of the sessions. Do you need to replicate exactly the same formats as in an in-person session? Can you take advantage of the online format? Some conferences offer a Twitter chat as a format. You could also adopt a text interview or panel similar to AMA on Reddit or a moderated online chat. Collaborative document editing such as a Wikipedia editathon or an online documentation sprint are also an option.</li>
<li>Think about the virtual space. Do you just want to have a traditional website with lists of links or something that gives the impression of being in space. 3D virtual spaces like Second Life gave people more of a sense of space but they excluded those who found them difficult to navigate. In general, people have good shared mental models of a website and the benefits of a 3D emulation of the physical space are not certain. On the other hand, giving some thought to what should be visually placed together on the website can help make up for the lack of the most natural affordances of space.</li>
<li>Think about the medium and modality. Encourage presenters and participants to turn on videos and to attend from spaces that support that. But also encourage people to upload photos (or integrate with LinkedIn) to make the virtual space more personal and add more visual cues to the space.</li>
<li>Think about the amount of written text on the event website. Do participants arrive to what looks like a website or something that naturally suggests things happening. Don’t waste space with welcome messages or long descriptions. Even a welcome video just gets in the way. The first thing participants arriving to a website of a live online event should see is where to go next, how to join what is happening.</li>
<li>Think about having a chat channel that is constantly monitored by event organisers. Making the chat public is another possibility to enable others to learn from previous questions.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="communication-and-presentation">Communication and presentation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Have a central repository of information about the event with details of how to connect front and centre and promote that. Don’t rely on emails with links.</li>
<li>Have a status board on the front of the event website with what sessions are happening right now and what is coming next. Don’t rely on the schedule with links to sessions. Maybe even have a counter of how many people are in sessions at the moment and have a ticker of questions or chat being asked.</li>
<li>Allow participants to sign up for individual sessions and make sure that they can integrate it into their calendar and get individual email reminders. Just having a schedule they can click on doesn’t take into account their need to integrate the event into their life.</li>
<li>Think about having stable links to virtual rooms and give the rooms a name. There is some potential for confusion as people join the wrong session or come in for a session that’s still running but it will replicate some of the serendipity of a live event. Having unique links for each session has some technical advantages because presenters and facilitators can prepare ahead of time but if you build enough breaks between sessions, this could alleviate the problem.</li>
<li>Let participants promote the event in ways that is natural. Having an event hashtag for Twitter and Instagram is easy. But you should also have collateral to share. Have images that people can put on Instagram, offer a tweet of the day prize for the weeks running up to the conference. Reward blogging about the event, etc. You should also take the time and promote participants and presenters. Have a featured section on the website where you profile a scheduled talk every day or have event attendee write a short blog post about sessions they’re planning to attend and why.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sessions">Sessions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Each live session needs to have 2 roles for success. A session moderator and session technical support.</li>
<li>The moderator (chair) introduces the presenter, keeps track of time and then moderates the discussion. If there is a chat functionality, they should monitor and answer routine questions and collate questions for asking later. They could also interrupt the presenter if the question seems urgent. This could be a role taken on by the presenter themselves as it often is in live events but not all presenters will have the ability to monitor all aspects of the session. It is particularly useful to have a second person available when questions come in via text who can read them out.</li>
<li>The technical support person helps troubleshoot issues with microphones, screen sharing, or other technical use of the platform. They may also be responsible for starting the session (depending on the platform). The moderator can play this role if technically adept, or one technical support person can look after multiple sessions. But event organisers should expect the need for more technical support for online events. Often, these people will have nothing to do but their presence makes much more difference.</li>
<li>Panels and round tables work well in the virtual format and can be successful when moderated well. This does work best when all panelists’ videos are visible. Most platforms also have features for creating break out groups which may be an option for replicating the unconference format.</li>
<li>Lightning talks are becoming increasingly popular at events and these would be very easy to replicate online (although they don’t seem to be). A number of presenters simply pass screensharing and microphone control over and present short (3–7 min) talks. This can be moderated easily and be augmented by the presence of a text chat channel.</li>
<li>Not all sessions have to be in the form of a live presentation to an audience. Here are four suggestions for alternatives:</li>
<li>Having an AMA (Ask me anything) style Q&amp;A that was popularised by Reddit can be a powerful engagement. A presenter (usually somebody with a unique experience or point of view) can be available for a specified period of time (anywhere from an hour to week) to answer questions that people type in. This works best if the person is sufficiently known or the size of the audience is large to ensure questions are asked. The organisers may also substitute questions.</li>
<li>Group chat known from platforms such as Slack or Teams could replicate the experience of a live panel. An example of how this works is a moderated Slack discussion published by the website FiveThirtyEight. This could be organised live and / or published afterwards. But immediacy is important. This format requires a panel of people who are sufficiently acquainted with this form of communication and a competent moderator.</li>
<li>Twitter chat where participants follow a topic (using a hashtag) for a specified amount of time (usually an hour) has become an established group communication medium. Here all of the event’s virtual attendees can participate. These work best when moderated and require that participants use Twitter. By its nature, this happens in the public eye but could be replicated in a closed platform by open chat.</li>
<li>Editathon is another medium where a group works together on creating or editing a document on a single topic. These were popularised by Wikipedia but can be implemented easily using a shared Google Doc. Editathons can last anywhere from an hour to a week (when they are longer, they are also sometimes called book sprints but these are usually in person) and work best when people commit to them and have some system of communication and moderation.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="social-environment">Social environment</h3>
<p>Giving the online event a sense of cohesion (time and place) is perhaps the most difficult aspect to replicate. This is where the Second Life platform offered the most potential because it was possible to see representations of other people in the same space. But virtual environments with avatars are not as easy to navigate for everyone as a website so will ultimately reduce participation. Here are some suggestions based on what has been tried:</p></p>

<p>There are essentially two kinds of platforms that can be considered for running live synchronous events.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Point-to-point platforms</strong> that are used primarily for organising one off webinars or meetings (such as Zoom, GoToWebinar, Big Blue Button and more)</li>
<li><strong>Integrated event platforms</strong> that facilitate the entire event from registration to communication to connecting participants live.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="affordances-of-point-to-point-platforms">Affordances of Point-to-point platforms</h3>
<p>The point-to-point platforms are well-established and well-understood. Most people in the education or corporate sectors have either participated in an online meeting run on one of these platforms or at least have some mental model of what it is about. At the very least, they can fall back on analogies, “it’s like a Skype call or Facetime”. Many more people will have also participated in webinars or watched recordings or them which is what these platforms are for.</p></p>

<p>We are seeing a flood of event cancellations in response to the global threat of COVID-19. This has triggered renewed interest in organising virtual conferences and generally moving face-to-face events into the virtual space. These discussions are not new. The environmental impact of the many thousands of events taking place around the world has had people question whether they should try to run more events online. But neither this nor the significant cost of attending these events has led to a significant reduction of conference travel.</p></p>

<p>His portrayal of the current social environment is well worth reading and rereading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you want to summarize the changes in family structure over the past century, the truest thing to say is this: We’ve made life freer for individuals and more unstable for families. We’ve made life better for adults but worse for children. We’ve moved from big, interconnected, and extended families, which helped protect the most vulnerable people in society from the shocks of life, to smaller, detached nuclear families (a married couple and their children), which give the most privileged people in society room to maximize their talents and expand their options.”</p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“it is substantially more difficult to explain what one does when one writes a sentence than it is to explain what one does when one composes a paragraph.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, it is much more difficult to talk about the mechanics of writing the sentence because we generally want to forget we are composing a sentence, whereas we want to focus on the fact we are composing a paragraph. In this, writing a sentence is much like riding a bicycle. You cannot really do it successfully while attending to every aspect of the process. Basbøll’s metaphor here is very apt:</p></p>

<p>When Samsung introduced the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Note_series">Galaxy Note in 2011</a>, everybody thought they were crazy because the 5.3 inch screen looked massive. People even felt the need to invent a new term for this, a ‘phablet’. When I saw friend hold her Note to her ear, it looked so strange I had to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Lq3SqpxKpQ/">take a picture</a>. When I look at it now, it looks perfectly normal.</p></p>

<p>The last decade also brought radical changes to the way we consume content. It even made the words ‘consume content’ make sense because it brought together watching TV, listening to music and reading books into the same category.</p></p>

<h3 id="dropbox-and-cloud-storage-andsync">Dropbox and cloud storage and sync</h3>
<p>For me, the first decade of the century was characterised by the USB stick. I always carried a few with me, usually around my neck. The USB drive replaced the previously ubiquitous floppy disk which was the data-transfer medium of the 1990s (even if they lost their floppiness). And while USB sticks are still extremely common and useful, they have been replaced in my life by cloud storage.</p></p>

<p>With reflections on the end of any period, there come not only summaries of the greatest successes but also the flops and failures. And the top of this decade proved no exception. The Verge lists <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019">84 biggest flops</a> across tech and Audrey Watters came up with <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2019/12/31/what-a-shitshow">100 debacles for ed tech</a> alone. While such schadenfreude may be entertaining or even occasionally edifying, that is not my purpose here.</p></p>
