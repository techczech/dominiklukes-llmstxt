title: How we use metaphors
---

I was reminded by [this blog post on LousyLinguist](http://thelousylinguist.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/the-birth-of-metaphor.html) that many people still see metaphor as an unproblematic homogeneous concept leading to much circular thinking about them.  I wrote about that quite a few years ago in:

Lukeš, D., 2005. Towards a classification of metaphor use in text: Issues in conceptual discourse analysis of a domain-specific corpus. In *Third Workshop on Corpus-Based Approaches to Figurative Language*. Birmingham.

I suggested that a classification of metaphor had better focused on their use rather than inherent nature. I came up with the heuristic device of: cognitive, social and textual uses of metaphor.

Some of the uses I came up with (inspired by the literature from Halliday to Lakoff) were:

* Cognitive
  + Conceptual (constitutive)
  + Attributive
* Social (Interpersonal)
  + Conceptual/Declarative (informational)
  + Figurative (elegant variation)
  + Innovative
  + Exegetic
  + Prevaricative
  + Performative
* Textual
  + Cohesive (anaphoric, cataphoric, exophoric)
  + Coherent

I also posited a continuum of salience and recoverability in metaphors:

* High salience and recoverability
* Low salience and recoverability

My thinking on metaphor has moved on since then – I see it as a special case of framing and conceptual integration rather than a sui generis concept – but I still find this a useful guide to return to when confronted with metaphor use.
