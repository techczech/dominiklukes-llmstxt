I always thought this little bit by Demetri Martin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DemetriMartin "Demetri Martin") highlights a crucial deficiency in any distinctive feature analysis.
Demetri Martin: “I was at a party, and I saw a guy with a leather jacket, and I thought, ‘That’s cool’. Then I saw a guy with a leather vest and I thought, ‘That’s not cool’. It was then that I realized what coolness is all about… leather sleeves.”

Is phonology all about leather sleeves?
