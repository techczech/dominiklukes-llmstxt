<p>Some years ago in a <a href="http://dominiklukes.net">book review</a>, I made an off-the-cuff comment that thriller writers tend to be quite right-wing in their outlook whereas science fiction authors are much more progressive and leftist. This is obviously an undue generalisation (as most of such comments tend to be) but it felt intuitively right. Even then I thought of Michael Chricton as the obvious counterexample – a thirller writer with distinctly liberal leanings – but I couldn’t think of a science fiction writer that would provide the counterexample. I put this down to my lack of comprehensive sci-fi reading and thought nothing more of it. Now, I’m not even sure that the general trend is there or at least that the implications are very straightforward.</p>
<p>Recently, I was listening to the excellent public policy lectures by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_A.R._Kleiman" title="Mark A.R. Kleiman">Mark Kleiman</a> and remembered that years ago, I’d read some similar suggestions in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio_of_a_Space_Tyrant">Bio of the Space Tyrant</a> by Pierce Anthony. It wasn’t a book (or rather a book series) I was going to reread but I set to it with a researcher’s determination. And frankly, I was shocked.</p>
<p>What I found was not a vision of a better society (Anthony projects the global politics of his day – the early 80s – into the Solar system 600 years hence) but rather a grotesque depiction of what the elites of the day would consider ‘common-sense’ policies: free-market entrepreneurship with social justice with a few twists. It was anti-corporalist and individualist on the surface but with a strong sense of collective duty (and pro-militarism) that was much more reminiscent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">fascism</a> than communism. It espoused strong, charismatic leadership with a sense of duty and most of all a belief in the necessity of change led by common sense. The needs of the collective justified the suppression of the individual in almost any way. But all of this is couched in good liberal politics (like the free press, free enterprise, etc.)</p>
<p>It is not clear whether Anthony means this as a parody of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">fascist</a> utopia but there are no hints there that this is the case. The overwhelming sense I get from this book is one of frustration of the intellectual elite that nobody is listening to what they have to say and a perverted picture of what the world would be like if they only got to start over with their policies.</p>
<p>Speaking of perverted. Through all of this is woven a bizzare and disturbing mix of patriarchy and progressive gender politics. On the one hand, Anthony is strongly against violence against women and treats women as strong and competent individuals. But on the other hand, his chief protagonist is an embodiment of a philanderer’s charter. All women love him but understand that he cannot love just one! The policies are there but what is to prevent any man from feeling that he is the one exception. So despite the progressive coating one is left feeling slightly unclean.</p>
<p>Now, is Anthony the exception I was looking for years ago? I don’t think so. First, I think he would fall in the liberal to libertarian camp if asked. But second, I don’t think he’s any exception at all. I recently reread some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">SciFi</a> classics and found hints of to full blown monuments to this rationalist yearning for control over society – the “if they only listened to us” syndrome, also known as the “TED syndrome”. We understand so much about how things work, so now we have the solution for how everything works. That’s why we should never seek to be ruled by philosopher kings (Plato, Hobbes, and any third rate philosopher – more likely to be fascist than liberal). Classics like “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mote_in_God%27s_Eye" title="The Mote in God's Eye">Mote in God’s Eye</a>“, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troupers" title="Starship Troupers">Starship Troupers</a>” (the movie was a parody but the book wasn’t), “Foundation” or less well-known ones like “<a href="http://www.scifi-az.com/">The Antares Trilogy</a>” or “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Fleet" title="The Lost Fleet">The Lost Fleet</a>“. They all unwittingly struggle with the dilemma of what happens when we know what to do but we also know that it can’t be achieved unless we have complete control. I found echoes of this even in cyberpunk like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash" title="Snow Crash">Snowcrash</a>.</p>
<p>So am I seeing a trend that isn’t there? I’m not as widely read in SciFi as other genres so it’s possible I just happened on books that confirm my thesis (such as it is). Again, the exception I can think of immediately is <a href="http://www.craphound.com/" title="Cory Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> whose “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Win-Cory-Doctorow/dp/0765322161%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dbohemicaco%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0765322161" title="For the Win">For the Win</a>” is as beautiful and sincere a depiction of the union movement as any song by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfXSlmWI_7c" title="Happy 90th Birthday Pete Seeger!">Pete Seger</a>. And I’m sure there are many more. But are there enough to make my impression just that? (Of course, there’s SciFi where this doesn’t come up, at all.)</p>
<p>But this tendency of the extremely intelligent and educated (and SciFi writers are on the whole just as well versed in anthropology as they are in science) to tell stories of how their images of the just society can be projected onto society as a whole is certainly a worrying presence in the genre. It seems to be largely absent From fantasy, which generally deals with journeys of individuals within existing worlds. And while these worlds may be dystopic, they generally are not changed, only explored. Fantasy has a strong thread of historical nostalgia – looking for a pure world of yore – which can be quite destructive when mis-projected to our own world. But on the whole, I feel, it contains less public policy than the average science fiction novel.</p>
