<p>I organised my first video lecture in 2002 when I was teaching in Glasgow and wanted students to get access to experts from London and Prague. It required a dedicated room and a technician on both ends, yet it seemed that an explosion of online teaching was just around the corner. But when I started a public lecture webinar series in 2010, online presentations were still a rarity. Now, webinars and virtual meetings are commonplace but we’re still not seeing a lot of entire events moving online. Even during the time of global lockdown and mass event cancelations, most events are simply cancelled even as teaching, meetings and music concerts move online. Why is that?</p></p>

<p>We are seeing a flood of event cancellations in response to the global threat of COVID-19. This has triggered renewed interest in organising virtual conferences and generally moving face-to-face events into the virtual space. These discussions are not new. The environmental impact of the many thousands of events taking place around the world has had people question whether they should try to run more events online. But neither this nor the significant cost of attending these events has led to a significant reduction of conference travel.</p></p>

<p>At the end of the next decade, the tech in our lives will be faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient, better connected, and smarter than it is today. But all these advances are going to be much more boring than we imagine. The world of tech will look more the same than different. I predict:</p></p>

<p>With reflections on the end of any period, there come not only summaries of the greatest successes but also the flops and failures. And the top of this decade proved no exception. The Verge lists <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019">84 biggest flops</a> across tech and Audrey Watters came up with <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2019/12/31/what-a-shitshow">100 debacles for ed tech</a> alone. While such schadenfreude may be entertaining or even occasionally edifying, that is not my purpose here.</p></p>

        <p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This is an edited version of my side of a discussion on an education technology mailing list.</p>
<p>I fully subscribe to the idea of thinking about pedagogy as being a type of technology (so are cultural institutions according to anthropologists and many people even think of language that way). But most people think of technology as ‘digital technology’ which is how ‘education technology’ is used. For them technology is a real or virtual machine that performs tasks independent of human intervention or in response to basic human actions. What I find most useful is switching between the two perspectives.</p></p>
