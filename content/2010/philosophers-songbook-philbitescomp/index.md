I was so inspired by the [#philbitescomp](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23philbitescomp) twitter contest that I wrote a short history of philosophy in tweetable fragments of songs.

*Parmenides’ lament:*I guess it will make a change  
when things stop changing

*Heracleitus’ blues:*  
I cried you the same river  
thrice

*Plato’s polka:*  
two steps out of the cave  
and look at what you’re doing

*Descartes’ swan song:*  
unbidden unwelcome it counts  
yet for a penny I perish

*Bishop Berkeley’s soccer fan chant:*  
Hey Samuel Johnson  
You’re kicking that rock in my mind

*Locke’s lullaby:*  
You’ve licked your plate clean  
And now what do you know?

*Kant’s shanty:*  
it’s a long way  
from first principles

*Voltaire’s spiritual:*  
Think low sweet chariot  
Believe in Him and don’t cheat me

*Hegel’s Carroll:*  
Give up the ghosts of times past  
Master and slave, together at last

*Marx’s revolutionary song:*  
I saw you coming Ford, a mile away  
But Lenin came out of left field

*Heidegger’s Rap:*  
With all my sein, I’ll do my zeit  
Those sons of canines might not bite

*Derrida and Wittgenstein’s duet:*Brick by brick move by move  
you say circuses I say no more

*High school philosophy teacher’s tattoo:*Be rational  
you scabs
