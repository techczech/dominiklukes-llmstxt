This post expands certain sections based on questions and feedback I received following the first publication of the piece. It is also available on my <a href=\"http://metaphorhacker.net/2020/06/no-back-row-no-corridor-metaphors-for-online-teaching-and-learning/\">blog Metaphorhacker.net</a>.</p><h3>The state of digital dislocation</h3><p>The current state of digital dislocation is forcing us to reevaluate what is the essence of teaching and learning. The “grammar of schooling” [1] has been taken away from us and we are forced to learn a new dialect by immersion with just a few phrasebooks, hastily pulled off the shelf, to guide us. Digital teaching is still teaching but it is teaching with an accent, one where we’re still trying to acquire enough fluency and idiomaticity to feel completely at home. When we add to it the culture shock of being in a new situation without any of the familiar cues, sights, sounds and smells of our native environment, it is not surprising that many people are feeling stressed and long for a swift return to “normal”. But it is also no surprise that many others are examining the current situation and finding the new land to be one of endless opportunity and thinking of establishing a permanent residence or at least buying a holiday home.</p><p>At one extreme, we are hearing voices calling online learning “clearly inferior,” lacking the essential personal contact that defines the University experience and asking whether the cost, expressed in fees, is too high. At the other pole, we hear “online teaching is clearly better,” doing away with all the distractions and deadweight of spaces, commutes and providing the focus so essential to learning. The same person can find themselves taking either position depending on the stage of culture shock they are living through at the moment. Both of these perspectives were reflected in an eloquent summary by Ray Williamson from the Oxford Student Union in a recent issue of the Oxford Magazine.[2] Here, I’d like to elaborate on what is at stake and look at ways of conceptualising the different perspectives.</p><h3>Making sense of digital with affordance metaphors</h3><p>I suggest that the two divergent views can best be reconciled when we contrast the affordances of the physical and virtual environments in which teaching and learning take place. By affordances I mean those features of the environment that present themselves to us for direct action and interaction and thus make the world around us meaningful and define what it means to live in the space we’re in. Affordance is a concept fundamental to design thinking and interaction and ignoring them is the most frequent cause of failure both in digital and physical products. [3]</p><p>The best way I found to bring the contrast between the physical and the virtual into focus are two metaphors that can be summarised as “No back row” and “No corridor”.</p><h3>“No back row”</h3><p>“No back row” expresses mostly the potential of the online experience to be positive for learning: the digital space is the great equaliser, no student is left hiding in the dark corner of the room, everybody’s contribution is coming from the front. This leads to higher engagement with the study material, and better learning. It is so powerful that the American online course provider 2U trademarked the slogan as part of their corporate philosophy [4]. Of course, just because it has the potential to be beneficial for learning, it doesn’t mean that we can just put the same course online and get its benefits. We have to design the online courses to take advantage of this. Nor should we be mislead by the visual metaphor of the Zoom call that 2U use on their corporate page. This applies to an entirely forum-based course, as well. The very fact that they have to engage with the content may put additional demands and stresses on students that will require support. This is in addition to the issues that are captured by the ‘no corridor’ metaphor.</p><h3>“No corridor”</h3><p>“No corridor” reflects the largely negative aspects of the virtual when contrasted with face to face. It reflects the lack of physical and social space connecting the learning situations. There are no natural landmarks to guide us, no flow of the crowd to follow. Everything has to be scheduled, bookmarked or emailed. There is little serendipity and no feeling of just “being there”. This makes it easy for a student to disappear and find themselves in “no row” at all. The physical space is doing a lot of work that is beyond the conscious notice of educators and programme administrators and allows them to be less specific in their instructions and leave things to ‘work themselves’ out without realising it. Their planning may be meticulous and painstaking but it is always framed by what the space affords them when it is filled with students, signs, and other signals that may feel almost subliminal. This can be easily seen when we compare the instructions students receive before arrival (what to bring, where to come, what to expect) and when they arrive which may be as little as a time table followed by ad-hoc announcements. And this comparison may gives clues to some aspects of mitigating the downsides of ‘no corridor’.</p><h3>Affordances of the physical vs virtual</h3><figure><img alt=\"“”\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-edmob2wLvw5euZi\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@ciabattespugnose?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Lucrezia Carnelos</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Luckily, we can mitigate the downsides of the virtual and amplify its benefits, if we pay careful attention to the affordances of the physical. There are successful ways of making up for the lack of the corridor’s hidden contribution to the learning process but we must avoid taking the normal environment in which learning takes place for granted. We rightly focus on personal relationships as essential to learning but as we saw above it is easy to underestimate the power of the spaces in which they are situated.</p><p>In the physical space, it is much easier to just follow the flow of the environment and learn, without realising it, by reflecting others’ reactions to it. There are spaces laid out so obviously that our use of them passes completely beneath any level of conscious notice. We do not need to deliberate on how to open doors, sit facing the speaker, not to sit in a seat already occupied. And where there are issues (locked doors, missing markers, drilling outside the window), we have established scripts for coping and frames for interpreting them.</p><p>None of these features are present in the virtual environment. Every action (at least initially), requires the effort of directed attention. We need to learn the “interfaces” of Zoom, establish routines of where to ‘find the link to join’, keep track of bookmarks for the learning materials, and manage actual time for virtual events and assignment deadlines. All of this virtual effort is taking place in an actual physical environment where we are the only person engaging in the activity. What’s worse, when we study or teach virtually, we do not appear to the world around us any different from when we idly browse the web or are binge-watching a TV show. We then have to negotiate with that environment and people in it in ways that travelling to ‘school’ or the ‘library’ does for us without any words having to be exchanged other than ‘I’m going to class’.</p><p>It’s no wonder many are finding themselves more stressed, tired and downright disoriented. But equally, to no one’s surprise, there are many who are thriving without the extra burden of the physical space which they may have found too overwhelming, full of distractions and uncertainties. We know that not all students cherish the demands of the physical spaces into which attending a university thrusts them; those who only feel comfortable huddled in the back row or for whom passage through the corridor is an exercise fraught with anxiety. Universities have ample built-in support structures and processes (albeit imperfect) for the latter but none for the former.</p><h3>For a successful online learning experience</h3><p>Yet, we know that it is possible to build a sense of “being there” in fully virtual environments and it is also possible to establish durable personal support relationships. This was possible even before the rise of Zoom or Teams as the success of Open University can attest but now it is even more within reach. Perhaps the most powerful indications of this are coming from the successes of telemedicine and even online psychotherapy. Many patients are finding that their one-on-one experience with a therapist is enhanced without the stressful overhead of travel, sitting in waiting rooms, walking through crowds, etc. [6]</p><p>Telemedicine also shows the way when we think about the heterogeneity of needs and inclinations. It is clearly not always appropriate to conduct therapeutic interventions over Skype but it is sufficient or even superior in more instances than may have been thought before the current situation made them a necessity. Do we think that education is radically different, here?</p><p>What does a University have to do to make the most of the benefits of ‘no back row’ and minimise the downsides of ‘no corridor’? What does the individual educator? The solutions are surprisingly simple and non-technical. Above all, we need to realise how much we can leave unsaid because the physical environment says it for us and then make it explicit in the virtual setting. We need to communicate more clearly and more frequently. We need to design the virtual learning spaces to minimize unnecessary cognitive load, structure information better, pay attention to navigation and consistency. We need to constantly fine-tune the balance between information overload and not enough information. We need to build structures that support the students who are struggling with the technological as well as personal aspects of learning.</p><h3>New roles for the relationship business</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*YYULQpRgFbqdh-lo\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@brookecagle?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Brooke Cagle</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>But ultimately and most importantly, we need to realise that educational institutions are not in the information business, they are in the relationship business (to borrow a metaphor from the media critic Jeff Jarvis [5]). It is easy to deploy an army of learning technologists and media production specialists, and think we’ve done virtual teaching justice. But online teaching requires other support roles and activities than just those leading to the deployment of “tech”.</p><p>There need to be roles whose main job it is to make sure students are opening the right virtual doors and sitting facing the right way in the virtual learning spaces. There need to be roles that pay attention to the real physical spaces and social situations on the other side of the Zoom call. When students are on campus, so much of this is done for us by the affordances of the space built up over centuries and so ingrained into our conceptual and perceptual systems that interacting with them feels to be a matter of instinct.</p><p>When all we have is emails, forum posts, webcams and the screen, we need to put in additional work to make up for this. Over time, it will come to seem as natural as what we have now but not without the initial effort. For instance, it is not anyone’s job to explicitly make sure students socialise with others in the physical environment. We don’t ask students if they “went out for a drink” with others when they’re on campus, but perhaps, it needs to be somebody’s job in the virtual situation. [7]</p><h3>Sources of learning</h3><p>Luckily, we have ample models of successful practice to draw on. The Open University is one such, Oxford’s own Continuing Education department is another. Private online education providers such as GetSmarter / 2U, who provided the first part of the metaphor, are others.</p><p>As far back as 2009 before Zoom or video conferencing, I taught a module on language and education in a physical setting followed a year later by a similar module in a fully online course for teachers. I was struck, when reading the final essays, how much more the online students seem to have engaged with the subject.</p><p>In the physical space, I had a feeling of engagement during my seminars with the students. But the ‘feedback’ I was getting from them hid the relative shallowness and unevenness of their engagement. I never saw the online students in person, so I had to design the course to get this feedback in other ways and I could easily see where all individual students were and guide them back in the right direction if they seemed to be floundering. It was more work for me and them but the learning gains were there to see.</p><p>The lessons of this anecdote are supported by research evidence and by experiences of educators the world over [8]. We do not need to provide inferior experiences to students just because they are not in the same room as us.</p><p>Eventually the world of university teaching and learning will return to “normal” but we should be mindful that culture shock happens on returning home, as well.[9] We can take advantage of what we learned during this forced sojourn in digital lands to develop a more robust bi-cultural approach to teaching by blending the best of both worlds.</p><h3>Footnotes</h3><p>[1] Tyack, D.B. and Cuban, L., 1995.

We need to communicate more clearly and more frequently. We need to design the virtual learning spaces to minimize unnecessary cognitive load, structure information better, pay attention to navigation and consistency. We need to constantly fine-tune the balance between information overload and not enough information. We need to build structures that support the students who are struggling with the technological as well as personal aspects of learning.</p><h3>New roles for the relationship business</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*YYULQpRgFbqdh-lo\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@brookecagle?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Brooke Cagle</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>But ultimately and most importantly, we need to realise that educational institutions are not in the information business, they are in the relationship business (to borrow a metaphor from the media critic Jeff Jarvis [5]). It is easy to deploy an army of learning technologists and media production specialists, and think we’ve done virtual teaching justice. But online teaching requires other support roles and activities than just those leading to the deployment of “tech”.</p><p>There need to be roles whose main job it is to make sure students are opening the right virtual doors and sitting facing the right way in the virtual learning spaces. There need to be roles that pay attention to the real physical spaces and social situations on the other side of the Zoom call. When students are on campus, so much of this is done for us by the affordances of the space built up over centuries and so ingrained into our conceptual and perceptual systems that interacting with them feels to be a matter of instinct.</p><p>When all we have is emails, forum posts, webcams and the screen, we need to put in additional work to make up for this. Over time, it will come to seem as natural as what we have now but not without the initial effort. For instance, it is not anyone’s job to explicitly make sure students socialise with others in the physical environment. We don’t ask students if they “went out for a drink” with others when they’re on campus, but perhaps, it needs to be somebody’s job in the virtual situation. [7]</p><h3>Sources of learning</h3><p>Luckily, we have ample models of successful practice to draw on. The Open University is one such, Oxford’s own Continuing Education department is another. Private online education providers such as GetSmarter / 2U, who provided the first part of the metaphor, are others.</p><p>As far back as 2009 before Zoom or video conferencing, I taught a module on language and education in a physical setting followed a year later by a similar module in a fully online course for teachers. I was struck, when reading the final essays, how much more the online students seem to have engaged with the subject.</p><p>In the physical space, I had a feeling of engagement during my seminars with the students. But the ‘feedback’ I was getting from them hid the relative shallowness and unevenness of their engagement. I never saw the online students in person, so I had to design the course to get this feedback in other ways and I could easily see where all individual students were and guide them back in the right direction if they seemed to be floundering. It was more work for me and them but the learning gains were there to see.</p><p>The lessons of this anecdote are supported by research evidence and by experiences of educators the world over [8]. We do not need to provide inferior experiences to students just because they are not in the same room as us.</p><p>Eventually the world of university teaching and learning will return to “normal” but we should be mindful that culture shock happens on returning home, as well.[9] We can take advantage of what we learned during this forced sojourn in digital lands to develop a more robust bi-cultural approach to teaching by blending the best of both worlds.</p><h3>Footnotes</h3><p>[1] Tyack, D.B. and Cuban, L., 1995.

Most people in the education or corporate sectors have either participated in an online meeting run on one of these platforms or at least have some mental model of what it is about. At the very least, they can fall back on analogies, “it’s like a Skype call or Facetime”. Many more people will have also participated in webinars or watched recordings or them which is what these platforms are for.</p><p>People will also have schemas and scripts around the basic requirements such as microphone and webcam. Although, these will not necessarily extend to knowing whether these are available on their device. But most people will be able to trigger intents such as muting/unmuting or using the chat. The scenario of noise coming from too many participants is a particularly familiar one.</p><p>Most participants will also have some sort of mental schema of what is required to join one of these events. It usually involves some meeting ID or link, occasionally a password. Generally, the process of joining involves opening an email or calendar invitation with these details and following the instructions.</p><p>Organisers of these events also have established routines on which they can fall back. Because these platforms are so well established, they have generally mastered the basics of the event scheduling interface that combined with a user’s basic mental model of what this event involves, it feels fairly intuitive and requires minimal instruction.</p><p>But we also need to take into account the business models of the point-to-point platforms. They are conceived and sold as products where one paid users runs one session at a time during which they are present — this could be a meeting or a webinar. But this breaks the event model of a multi-room space. For instance, an institution may have assigned Zoom accounts to a number of individuals but for the running of an online events, Zoom accounts would either have to be temporarily purchased or existing user accounts would have to be tied up.</p><h3>Zoom and the rest: Meeting and webinar platforms</h3><p>From a world where there were once “the big three”: Webex, Gotomeeting and Adobe Connect, we now live in a world of tens of providers. Given that the underlying technology of video conferencing is now basically commoditised, the basic meeting experience will be fairly similar and reliable. People can reasonably expect basic reliability and a minimum of features. I have used all of the big three as an organiser and participant of meetings and webinars. And while there are differences, the basics are essentially the same.</p><p>However, recently Zoom has emerged as the platform that is increasingly far ahead of the pack. With what seems a singular focus on improvement and features that focus on the whole experience of organising and attending events, it seems not only have the features but also the reputation. This may be because unlike the ‘big three’, Zoom is a business with just one product whereas all the others are just divisions of organisations with an extensive product portfolio.</p><p>As always, there are many other players in the space nipping at the heels of the big guys. They all have a place and seem to be able to attract customers. Some that come to mind because I’ve seen people using them are Blue Jeans and BigMarker. But this article on 10 platforms to use during COVID-19 crisis <a href=\"https://www.ventureharbour.com/webinar-software-10-best-webinar-platforms-compared/\">https://www.ventureharbour.com/webinar-software-10-best-webinar-platforms-compared/</a> lists many I’ve never even heard of.</p><h3>Skype, Teams, Google Hangouts, Facetime: Meeting platforms</h3><p>The platforms that perhaps did the most for bringing the idea of online meetings to public awareness were Skype and Facetime. Skype because of its venerable origins and Facetime (very much a latecomer) because of the high profile of Apple’s ecosystem. Skyping and Facetiming have become part of the common vocabulary.</p><p>While they are not really viable platforms for online events, they are important consider because they provide important mental schemas (both positive and negative) for potential participants. Also, they have slowly been expanding their feature set so that they are increasingly overlapping with meeting and webinar platforms.</p><p>In particular, Microsoft Teams (slated to replace Skype for Business) is being positioned as an education and meeting platform. And it is possible that it will soon become a viable player and it is already a usable option within institutions that are within Microsoft Office 365 the ecosystem. However, the feature set and ease of use is not there, yet, to make it a viable candidate for online events.</p><p>Google Hangouts is in a similar position. It is an established and reliable platform but it would be a viable online event platform only within institutions who use the Google Suite.</p><p>Jitsi is an open source player of some note in this space and could possibly be used for this purpose. An organisation can run their own server and individuals can use the free <a href=\"https://meet.jit.si/\">https://meet.jit.si</a> backed by the commercial player 8x8.</p><h3>Smaller players focusing on education: BBB, Bb Collaborate</h3><p>There are many smaller players focusing on the education market. Blackboard Collaborate (formerly Illuminate) is perhaps the most venerable of them all. It is still used by many universities around the world but probably not a platform to choose for those entering the market. Compared to Zoom, it just does not have all the features — most notably limit on video from participants. However, it has been successfully used for several years by the Association for Learning Technology to run their winter online conferences.</p><p>One last platform worth noting is Big Blue Button which has the distinction of being open source and therefore allowing self-hosting. It is also integrated with the Canvas LMS which means it has a wider reach than might otherwise be the case. It is definitely good enough for single virtual classes and has some best-in-class features but perhaps not something to look for for a large-scale event.</p><p>There are many more smaller players and platforms but I would personally not recommend going too far afield. Perhaps one of them is the future Zoom — who also came out of nowhere in the last few years — but usually, they just can’t compete on actually useful features or quality.</p><h3>Integrated virtual event platforms</h3><p>Integrated event platforms are trying to replicate some of the affordances of physical space for the participants. People choosing them have at least two decisions to make:</p><ol><li>Should the integrated platform provide virtual representation of the physical space — be this in 2D or 3D form or should it just be an integrated website?</li><li>Should the integrated platform simply incorporate an existing point-to-point solution or provide its own video conferencing environment?</li></ol><p>Because the platforms are so new and none have become established, we know much less about which combination of the decisions is best. Unfortunately, we have some conflicting principles of design to contend with when making a decision.</p><p>At first glance, it would appear that a platform that replicates the physical environment with a fully integrated native video conferencing platform would be best. This combination would create a unified experience for event attendees by replicating their mental models of events and not requiring abrupt changes in interface as they join individual meetings and sessions.</p><p>But those assumptions run into the roadblock of overall user experience principles. Creating a 2D or 3D representation of a physical space breaks users’ existing models of how web-pages work. They may present a seemingly intuitive environment but since the interaction is still primarily mediated by the mouse, users also need to be able to know where to click. This requires very close attention to user experience on the part of the platform designers and may present impossible dilemmas. Particularly, when it comes to 3D, the ability of users to navigate a 3D space cannot be taken for granted. The event would essentially be placed in a video-game environment and this will exclude many users. Second Life was an example of a very promising 3D space for learning but ultimately failed because of the interaction barriers to entry for many users.</p><p>Ultimately, an integrated platform that relies on more established mental models of web navigation with close attention to providing relevant and timely information may be more successful. Possibly, there could be a middle ground where some skeuomorphic graphical elements could be applied to the interface without breaking the underlying model of a website. It is possible that a new platform replicating the physical environment may be successful despite all of these issues, but event organisers should be very cautious about how they onboard users.</p><p>The same considerations apply to the question of whether organisers should choose a platform with its own integrated video conferencing or one that simply provides an interface for embedding an existing point-to-point platform such as Zoom.</p><p>An integrated video conferencing has some obvious advantages. First, it does not require that the organisers have multiple subscriptions. Second, it allows the provider to further unify the look and feel of the environment and to think more deeply about the affordances of space. For instance, it can introduce the concept of neighbours or give visual indicators of whether a room is occupied or not.</p><p>However, this has its own limitations. First, while the core technology for video conferencing has become commoditised (mostly thanks to the introduction of WebRTC), developing the wealth of features an established platform like Zoom has is a massive undertaking. A new product may introduce a feature or interface innovation that is better than what Zoom or Big Blue Button offer (for which there is ample room), but they may do that at the expense of other features.</p><p>Since any such integrated platform is most likely relying on WebRTC, it will be limited to which browsers it runs in and may not have a very good mobile experience. For instance, it may not be accessible via an iPad or it may not have a phone bridge.</p><p>This integrated platform will also not be able to drawas much on the wealth of experience potential attendees have with established point-to-point platforms. This may not be much of a hindrance where the feature set is limited and the UX design builds on exiting models. But it should be taken into account.</p><h3>Integrated platform (p)reviews</h3><p>I was able to identify six integrated event platforms on the market today. While, so far, every single platform, I’ve mentioned, I’ve also used either as a participant, organiser or attendee (and most often all), I don’t have any personal experiences with any of these products, nor do I have access to an extensive body of user testimonials outside those provided by the platforms. All I can base my assessment on is a review of their documentation and perhaps a brief trial where possible.</p><p>The two event platforms that attracted me the most were HeySummit and vFairs because they would allow me to integrate Zoom and other existing video providers. However, they differ in their approach to replicating the space.</p><p><strong>HeySummit</strong> very firmly builds on the website conceptual model but integrates all aspects of user and speaker management and support. This makes it much easier to get started with an event. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous events. One such event was <a href=\"https://missinglettr.com/uppercase/\">Uppercase </a>that is available to join but for a fee. It works with several webinar providers but their Zoom integration is a big disappointment because it only supports webinars. These don’t provide nearly the level of interaction as Zoom meetings for smaller events. Also, Zoom webinars are significantly more expensive. On the other hand, each host can have a different webinar provider. But each session can also have a link which could be pointing to a Zoom meeting — but any integration would be lost and HeySummit would just become an event website. Interestingly, one of the webinar providers is Remo (see below).</p><p><strong>vFairs</strong>, on the other hand, replicates the 3D environment and is aimed more at emulating a fair such as a University Open day or a Trade show. It also provides all the other speaker and attendee management features. While it allows the creation of visually appealing 3D spaces including virtual lobby and virtual booths, it is not clear what the actual user experience will be like. <strong>Ubivent</strong> takes a similar approach to vFairs but seems to be a less polished product and does not list its features in detail.</p><p>The final three platforms, Remo, GoBrunch and Hopin all have something of interest. But I’m not sure how much I would want to rely on their own video conferencing. Particularly those relying on WebRTC which limits the ways in which people can connect.</p><p><strong>Remo</strong> is very interesting because it replicates well the experience of having a number of a tables one could join for small discussions. It would work well for networking events, unconference style events (with very small groups) or small vendor booths. Participants see a list of tables with indicators of who is sitting there and whether they can join. But it does not look like it would work well for a more traditional type of conference with speakers and sessions. As I mentioned , it can be integrated as the video provider in a Heysummit event which would make it possible to add a networking experience to a more traditional event.</p><p><strong>GoBrunch</strong> is puzzlingly free for events up to 500 people. It offers ability to create rooms with different layouts in 2D where participants can take seats in a place — it includes a layout similar to Remo but also many more including a lecture theatre. But other than that, it’s not clear how the participants interact. Ultimately, it seems that the graphical interface would just get in the way. It is an interesting proof of concept but it’s not even clear that it works.</p><p><strong>Hopin</strong> is a new platform that is still in preview but I know a few events are testing it now. Unlike Remo or GoBrunch, it does not make any attempt to visually represent the conference space but it focuses more on directing attendees to the right place. The major limitation is that it only supports the latest browsers and may have limited mobile accessibility. This is a problem shared by all WebRTC platforms.</p><p>In summary, I am not fully convinced that any of these integrated platforms have come up with a solution to the affordance challenges I outlined in the first part. If we look at the recommendations and strategies section, many of those could be solved by good design of a website. But all of my observations and impressions are based on either a scan of the provider website or a brief play with a test account where available. So it is possible that there are hidden strengths (or weaknesses) that would only come through when running an actual event.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-part-2-strategies-what-can-we-learn-from-successful-online-events-8ae2dbf40703?sk=632297047eef8329e3b5d74db3cc832d\"><strong>Part 2: Strategies</strong></a><strong> </strong>&lt;&lt;Previous |</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=fd8e2b05b7f0\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-part-3-platforms-what-technologies-and-solutions-are-available-fd8e2b05b7f0\">Moving Events Online Part 3: Platforms: What technologies and solutions are available?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech\">TechCzech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

Most people in the education or corporate sectors have either participated in an online meeting run on one of these platforms or at least have some mental model of what it is about. At the very least, they can fall back on analogies, “it’s like a Skype call or Facetime”. Many more people will have also participated in webinars or watched recordings or them which is what these platforms are for.</p><p>People will also have schemas and scripts around the basic requirements such as microphone and webcam. Although, these will not necessarily extend to knowing whether these are available on their device. But most people will be able to trigger intents such as muting/unmuting or using the chat. The scenario of noise coming from too many participants is a particularly familiar one.</p><p>Most participants will also have some sort of mental schema of what is required to join one of these events. It usually involves some meeting ID or link, occasionally a password. Generally, the process of joining involves opening an email or calendar invitation with these details and following the instructions.</p><p>Organisers of these events also have established routines on which they can fall back. Because these platforms are so well established, they have generally mastered the basics of the event scheduling interface that combined with a user’s basic mental model of what this event involves, it feels fairly intuitive and requires minimal instruction.</p><p>But we also need to take into account the business models of the point-to-point platforms. They are conceived and sold as products where one paid users runs one session at a time during which they are present — this could be a meeting or a webinar. But this breaks the event model of a multi-room space. For instance, an institution may have assigned Zoom accounts to a number of individuals but for the running of an online events, Zoom accounts would either have to be temporarily purchased or existing user accounts would have to be tied up.</p><h3>Zoom and the rest: Meeting and webinar platforms</h3><p>From a world where there were once “the big three”: Webex, Gotomeeting and Adobe Connect, we now live in a world of tens of providers. Given that the underlying technology of video conferencing is now basically commoditised, the basic meeting experience will be fairly similar and reliable. People can reasonably expect basic reliability and a minimum of features. I have used all of the big three as an organiser and participant of meetings and webinars. And while there are differences, the basics are essentially the same.</p><p>However, recently Zoom has emerged as the platform that is increasingly far ahead of the pack. With what seems a singular focus on improvement and features that focus on the whole experience of organising and attending events, it seems not only have the features but also the reputation. This may be because unlike the ‘big three’, Zoom is a business with just one product whereas all the others are just divisions of organisations with an extensive product portfolio.</p><p>As always, there are many other players in the space nipping at the heels of the big guys. They all have a place and seem to be able to attract customers. Some that come to mind because I’ve seen people using them are Blue Jeans and BigMarker. But this article on 10 platforms to use during COVID-19 crisis <a href=\"https://www.ventureharbour.com/webinar-software-10-best-webinar-platforms-compared/\">https://www.ventureharbour.com/webinar-software-10-best-webinar-platforms-compared/</a> lists many I’ve never even heard of.</p><h3>Skype, Teams, Google Hangouts, Facetime: Meeting platforms</h3><p>The platforms that perhaps did the most for bringing the idea of online meetings to public awareness were Skype and Facetime. Skype because of its venerable origins and Facetime (very much a latecomer) because of the high profile of Apple’s ecosystem. Skyping and Facetiming have become part of the common vocabulary.</p><p>While they are not really viable platforms for online events, they are important consider because they provide important mental schemas (both positive and negative) for potential participants. Also, they have slowly been expanding their feature set so that they are increasingly overlapping with meeting and webinar platforms.</p><p>In particular, Microsoft Teams (slated to replace Skype for Business) is being positioned as an education and meeting platform. And it is possible that it will soon become a viable player and it is already a usable option within institutions that are within Microsoft Office 365 the ecosystem. However, the feature set and ease of use is not there, yet, to make it a viable candidate for online events.</p><p>Google Hangouts is in a similar position. It is an established and reliable platform but it would be a viable online event platform only within institutions who use the Google Suite.</p><p>Jitsi is an open source player of some note in this space and could possibly be used for this purpose. An organisation can run their own server and individuals can use the free <a href=\"https://meet.jit.si/\">https://meet.jit.si</a> backed by the commercial player 8x8.</p><h3>Smaller players focusing on education: BBB, Bb Collaborate</h3><p>There are many smaller players focusing on the education market. Blackboard Collaborate (formerly Illuminate) is perhaps the most venerable of them all. It is still used by many universities around the world but probably not a platform to choose for those entering the market. Compared to Zoom, it just does not have all the features — most notably limit on video from participants. However, it has been successfully used for several years by the Association for Learning Technology to run their winter online conferences.</p><p>One last platform worth noting is Big Blue Button which has the distinction of being open source and therefore allowing self-hosting. It is also integrated with the Canvas LMS which means it has a wider reach than might otherwise be the case. It is definitely good enough for single virtual classes and has some best-in-class features but perhaps not something to look for for a large-scale event.</p><p>There are many more smaller players and platforms but I would personally not recommend going too far afield. Perhaps one of them is the future Zoom — who also came out of nowhere in the last few years — but usually, they just can’t compete on actually useful features or quality.</p><h3>Integrated virtual event platforms</h3><p>Integrated event platforms are trying to replicate some of the affordances of physical space for the participants. People choosing them have at least two decisions to make:</p><ol><li>Should the integrated platform provide virtual representation of the physical space — be this in 2D or 3D form or should it just be an integrated website?</li><li>Should the integrated platform simply incorporate an existing point-to-point solution or provide its own video conferencing environment?</li></ol><p>Because the platforms are so new and none have become established, we know much less about which combination of the decisions is best. Unfortunately, we have some conflicting principles of design to contend with when making a decision.</p><p>At first glance, it would appear that a platform that replicates the physical environment with a fully integrated native video conferencing platform would be best. This combination would create a unified experience for event attendees by replicating their mental models of events and not requiring abrupt changes in interface as they join individual meetings and sessions.</p><p>But those assumptions run into the roadblock of overall user experience principles. Creating a 2D or 3D representation of a physical space breaks users’ existing models of how web-pages work. They may present a seemingly intuitive environment but since the interaction is still primarily mediated by the mouse, users also need to be able to know where to click. This requires very close attention to user experience on the part of the platform designers and may present impossible dilemmas. Particularly, when it comes to 3D, the ability of users to navigate a 3D space cannot be taken for granted. The event would essentially be placed in a video-game environment and this will exclude many users. Second Life was an example of a very promising 3D space for learning but ultimately failed because of the interaction barriers to entry for many users.</p><p>Ultimately, an integrated platform that relies on more established mental models of web navigation with close attention to providing relevant and timely information may be more successful. Possibly, there could be a middle ground where some skeuomorphic graphical elements could be applied to the interface without breaking the underlying model of a website. It is possible that a new platform replicating the physical environment may be successful despite all of these issues, but event organisers should be very cautious about how they onboard users.</p><p>The same considerations apply to the question of whether organisers should choose a platform with its own integrated video conferencing or one that simply provides an interface for embedding an existing point-to-point platform such as Zoom.</p><p>An integrated video conferencing has some obvious advantages. First, it does not require that the organisers have multiple subscriptions. Second, it allows the provider to further unify the look and feel of the environment and to think more deeply about the affordances of space. For instance, it can introduce the concept of neighbours or give visual indicators of whether a room is occupied or not.</p><p>However, this has its own limitations. First, while the core technology for video conferencing has become commoditised (mostly thanks to the introduction of WebRTC), developing the wealth of features an established platform like Zoom has is a massive undertaking. A new product may introduce a feature or interface innovation that is better than what Zoom or Big Blue Button offer (for which there is ample room), but they may do that at the expense of other features.</p><p>Since any such integrated platform is most likely relying on WebRTC, it will be limited to which browsers it runs in and may not have a very good mobile experience. For instance, it may not be accessible via an iPad or it may not have a phone bridge.</p><p>This integrated platform will also not be able to drawas much on the wealth of experience potential attendees have with established point-to-point platforms. This may not be much of a hindrance where the feature set is limited and the UX design builds on exiting models. But it should be taken into account.</p><h3>Integrated platform (p)reviews</h3><p>I was able to identify six integrated event platforms on the market today. While, so far, every single platform, I’ve mentioned, I’ve also used either as a participant, organiser or attendee (and most often all), I don’t have any personal experiences with any of these products, nor do I have access to an extensive body of user testimonials outside those provided by the platforms. All I can base my assessment on is a review of their documentation and perhaps a brief trial where possible.</p><p>The two event platforms that attracted me the most were HeySummit and vFairs because they would allow me to integrate Zoom and other existing video providers. However, they differ in their approach to replicating the space.</p><p><strong>HeySummit</strong> very firmly builds on the website conceptual model but integrates all aspects of user and speaker management and support. This makes it much easier to get started with an event. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous events. One such event was <a href=\"https://missinglettr.com/uppercase/\">Uppercase </a>that is available to join but for a fee. It works with several webinar providers but their Zoom integration is a big disappointment because it only supports webinars. These don’t provide nearly the level of interaction as Zoom meetings for smaller events. Also, Zoom webinars are significantly more expensive. On the other hand, each host can have a different webinar provider. But each session can also have a link which could be pointing to a Zoom meeting — but any integration would be lost and HeySummit would just become an event website. Interestingly, one of the webinar providers is Remo (see below).</p><p><strong>vFairs</strong>, on the other hand, replicates the 3D environment and is aimed more at emulating a fair such as a University Open day or a Trade show. It also provides all the other speaker and attendee management features. While it allows the creation of visually appealing 3D spaces including virtual lobby and virtual booths, it is not clear what the actual user experience will be like. <strong>Ubivent</strong> takes a similar approach to vFairs but seems to be a less polished product and does not list its features in detail.</p><p>The final three platforms, Remo, GoBrunch and Hopin all have something of interest. But I’m not sure how much I would want to rely on their own video conferencing. Particularly those relying on WebRTC which limits the ways in which people can connect.</p><p><strong>Remo</strong> is very interesting because it replicates well the experience of having a number of a tables one could join for small discussions. It would work well for networking events, unconference style events (with very small groups) or small vendor booths. Participants see a list of tables with indicators of who is sitting there and whether they can join. But it does not look like it would work well for a more traditional type of conference with speakers and sessions. As I mentioned , it can be integrated as the video provider in a Heysummit event which would make it possible to add a networking experience to a more traditional event.</p><p><strong>GoBrunch</strong> is puzzlingly free for events up to 500 people. It offers ability to create rooms with different layouts in 2D where participants can take seats in a place — it includes a layout similar to Remo but also many more including a lecture theatre. But other than that, it’s not clear how the participants interact. Ultimately, it seems that the graphical interface would just get in the way. It is an interesting proof of concept but it’s not even clear that it works.</p><p><strong>Hopin</strong> is a new platform that is still in preview but I know a few events are testing it now. Unlike Remo or GoBrunch, it does not make any attempt to visually represent the conference space but it focuses more on directing attendees to the right place. The major limitation is that it only supports the latest browsers and may have limited mobile accessibility. This is a problem shared by all WebRTC platforms.</p><p>In summary, I am not fully convinced that any of these integrated platforms have come up with a solution to the affordance challenges I outlined in the first part. If we look at the recommendations and strategies section, many of those could be solved by good design of a website. But all of my observations and impressions are based on either a scan of the provider website or a brief play with a test account where available. So it is possible that there are hidden strengths (or weaknesses) that would only come through when running an actual event.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-part-2-strategies-what-can-we-learn-from-successful-online-events-8ae2dbf40703?sk=632297047eef8329e3b5d74db3cc832d\"><strong>Part 2: Strategies</strong></a><strong> </strong>&lt;&lt;Previous |</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=fd8e2b05b7f0\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-part-3-platforms-what-technologies-and-solutions-are-available-fd8e2b05b7f0\">Moving Events Online Part 3: Platforms: What technologies and solutions are available?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech\">TechCzech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

Many people have written about some of their experiences that we can learn from. Being more aware of the affordance mismatch between online and physical events can help us make the most of these tips and augment them.</p><h3>Tips for organisers</h3><h4>Initial considerations</h4><ol><li>Think about the format of the event. Does it have to be just a day or two or can you split a day into a week or two worth of sessions? A more concentrated event can develop more of a feel of unity but may be more intensive to organise and harder to attend for people who join from their place of work.</li><li>Think about whether you want the event to be synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous events put much lower demands on presenters and will also have more engagement. People are more likely to attend an hour-long live event than watch the same length video recording. Successful asynchronous events require more intensive moderation with a time commitment for organisers that may span weeks.</li><li>Think about the formats of the sessions. Do you need to replicate exactly the same formats as in an in-person session? Can you take advantage of the online format? Some conferences offer a Twitter chat as a format. You could also adopt a text interview or panel similar to AMA on Reddit or a moderated online chat. Collaborative document editing such as a Wikipedia editathon or an online documentation sprint are also an option.</li><li>Think about the virtual space. Do you just want to have a traditional website with lists of links or something that gives the impression of being in space. 3D virtual spaces like Second Life gave people more of a sense of space but they excluded those who found them difficult to navigate. In general, people have good shared mental models of a website and the benefits of a 3D emulation of the physical space are not certain. On the other hand, giving some thought to what should be visually placed together on the website can help make up for the lack of the most natural affordances of space.</li><li>Think about the medium and modality. Encourage presenters and participants to turn on videos and to attend from spaces that support that. But also encourage people to upload photos (or integrate with LinkedIn) to make the virtual space more personal and add more visual cues to the space.</li><li>Think about the amount of written text on the event website. Do participants arrive to what looks like a website or something that naturally suggests things happening. Don’t waste space with welcome messages or long descriptions. Even a welcome video just gets in the way. The first thing participants arriving to a website of a live online event should see is where to go next, how to join what is happening.</li><li>Think about having a chat channel that is constantly monitored by event organisers. Making the chat public is another possibility to enable others to learn from previous questions.</li></ol><h3>Communication and presentation</h3><ol><li>Have a central repository of information about the event with details of how to connect front and centre and promote that. Don’t rely on emails with links.</li><li>Have a status board on the front of the event website with what sessions are happening right now and what is coming next. Don’t rely on the schedule with links to sessions. Maybe even have a counter of how many people are in sessions at the moment and have a ticker of questions or chat being asked.</li><li>Allow participants to sign up for individual sessions and make sure that they can integrate it into their calendar and get individual email reminders. Just having a schedule they can click on doesn’t take into account their need to integrate the event into their life.</li><li>Think about having stable links to virtual rooms and give the rooms a name. There is some potential for confusion as people join the wrong session or come in for a session that’s still running but it will replicate some of the serendipity of a live event. Having unique links for each session has some technical advantages because presenters and facilitators can prepare ahead of time but if you build enough breaks between sessions, this could alleviate the problem.</li><li>Let participants promote the event in ways that is natural. Having an event hashtag for Twitter and Instagram is easy. But you should also have collateral to share. Have images that people can put on Instagram, offer a tweet of the day prize for the weeks running up to the conference. Reward blogging about the event, etc. You should also take the time and promote participants and presenters. Have a featured section on the website where you profile a scheduled talk every day or have event attendee write a short blog post about sessions they’re planning to attend and why.</li></ol><h3>Sessions</h3><ol><li>Each live session needs to have 2 roles for success. A session moderator and session technical support.</li><li>The moderator (chair) introduces the presenter, keeps track of time and then moderates the discussion. If there is a chat functionality, they should monitor and answer routine questions and collate questions for asking later. They could also interrupt the presenter if the question seems urgent. This could be a role taken on by the presenter themselves as it often is in live events but not all presenters will have the ability to monitor all aspects of the session. It is particularly useful to have a second person available when questions come in via text who can read them out.</li><li>The technical support person helps troubleshoot issues with microphones, screen sharing, or other technical use of the platform. They may also be responsible for starting the session (depending on the platform). The moderator can play this role if technically adept, or one technical support person can look after multiple sessions. But event organisers should expect the need for more technical support for online events. Often, these people will have nothing to do but their presence makes much more difference.</li><li>Panels and round tables work well in the virtual format and can be successful when moderated well. This does work best when all panelists’ videos are visible. Most platforms also have features for creating break out groups which may be an option for replicating the unconference format.</li><li>Lightning talks are becoming increasingly popular at events and these would be very easy to replicate online (although they don’t seem to be). A number of presenters simply pass screensharing and microphone control over and present short (3–7 min) talks. This can be moderated easily and be augmented by the presence of a text chat channel.</li><li>Not all sessions have to be in the form of a live presentation to an audience. Here are four suggestions for alternatives:</li><li>Having an AMA (Ask me anything) style Q&amp;A that was popularised by Reddit can be a powerful engagement. A presenter (usually somebody with a unique experience or point of view) can be available for a specified period of time (anywhere from an hour to week) to answer questions that people type in. This works best if the person is sufficiently known or the size of the audience is large to ensure questions are asked. The organisers may also substitute questions.</li><li>Group chat known from platforms such as Slack or Teams could replicate the experience of a live panel. An example of how this works is a moderated Slack discussion published by the website FiveThirtyEight. This could be organised live and / or published afterwards. But immediacy is important. This format requires a panel of people who are sufficiently acquainted with this form of communication and a competent moderator.</li><li>Twitter chat where participants follow a topic (using a hashtag) for a specified amount of time (usually an hour) has become an established group communication medium. Here all of the event’s virtual attendees can participate. These work best when moderated and require that participants use Twitter. By its nature, this happens in the public eye but could be replicated in a closed platform by open chat.</li><li>Editathon is another medium where a group works together on creating or editing a document on a single topic. These were popularised by Wikipedia but can be implemented easily using a shared Google Doc. Editathons can last anywhere from an hour to a week (when they are longer, they are also sometimes called book sprints but these are usually in person) and work best when people commit to them and have some system of communication and moderation.</li></ol><h3>Social environment</h3><p>Giving the online event a sense of cohesion (time and place) is perhaps the most difficult aspect to replicate. This is where the Second Life platform offered the most potential because it was possible to see representations of other people in the same space. But virtual environments with avatars are not as easy to navigate for everyone as a website so will ultimately reduce participation. Here are some suggestions based on what has been tried:</p><ol><li>A constantly open virtual room (cafe) where participants can join talk with each other. This should be constantly moderated so that somebody coming in at any time would always have someone to interact with. One way to promote this space would be to ask all presenters to spend at least 15 minutes there after the session to communicate.</li><li>Some conferences have tried to have a short (30 min) session at the start of each day and the end of each day to summarise key lessons, answer questions, and point to what will happen next. These need to be relevant and offer some reward to ensure attendance. Perhaps inviting select attendees to give a 3 minute summary of their highlights of the day could be a way to make it more popular.</li><li>Moderators of all sessions should always start with a summary of how the event is going and what sessions are coming up next (or running in parallel) .</li><li>A live ticker of how many people are in events or how many people are on the website and available to chat to could be integrated into the interface of the sessions.</li><li>A unified event chat running alongside the session chats (or instead) could make it easier for everyone to get a sense of the whole event. This would provide a bit of distraction but also bring the event together. This is replicated by a Twitter hashtag at most conferences.

Watching at your normal desk at the office invites distractions.</li><li>Put an out of office on your email so that others know you are otherwise occupied and you don’t feel the social obligation to check and respond to email during sessions.</li><li>Do not schedule anything else such as meetings between virtual sessions you want to attend.

Outline rules for when such events can be overtaken by things that come up at the office and when not. Encourage working from home when attending a virtual event. Ensure that line managers respect online attendance.</li><li>Ensure that all your staff have the technical equipment and skills to attend. Making sure that everyone has a headset with a microphone and ideally a webcam makes attending online events easier. Have a spare collection of headsets to replace broken ones (they break often) without any need for a formal requisition process. Make sure your IT support understands the various online platforms and can support individuals’ connection problems.</li><li>Dedicate a meeting room to online attendances and virtual training. This could be a room set up for hotdesking or potentially some PCs where multiple people could sit and learn online. But you should also have remote communication pods where the online attendees can feel free to turn on their webcam and speak when required.</li><li>Have a dedicated space from which people can present online. Ideally, the presenter should be able to present standing up and have at least 2 monitors available. This room or space should have a high quality noise-cancelling headset and a high-resolution camera. The PC in this room should be powerful enough and have a wired network connection to ensure the quality of presentation.</li></ol><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-part-1-challenges-why-are-not-more-events-taking-place-online-a1b94533649c?sk=cd797ca3ef7c092c2a2bbaafcff09e4c\"><strong>Part 1: Challenges</strong></a><strong> </strong>&lt;&lt;Previous | Next&gt;&gt;<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-part-2-strategies-what-can-we-learn-from-successful-online-events-8ae2dbf40703?sk=632297047eef8329e3b5d74db3cc832d\"><strong>Part 2: Strategies</strong></a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8ae2dbf40703\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-part-2-strategies-what-can-we-learn-from-successful-online-events-8ae2dbf40703\">Moving Events Online Part 2: Strategies: What can we learn from successful online events?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech\">TechCzech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

Many people have written about some of their experiences that we can learn from. Being more aware of the affordance mismatch between online and physical events can help us make the most of these tips and augment them.</p><h3>Tips for organisers</h3><h4>Initial considerations</h4><ol><li>Think about the format of the event. Does it have to be just a day or two or can you split a day into a week or two worth of sessions? A more concentrated event can develop more of a feel of unity but may be more intensive to organise and harder to attend for people who join from their place of work.</li><li>Think about whether you want the event to be synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous events put much lower demands on presenters and will also have more engagement. People are more likely to attend an hour-long live event than watch the same length video recording. Successful asynchronous events require more intensive moderation with a time commitment for organisers that may span weeks.</li><li>Think about the formats of the sessions. Do you need to replicate exactly the same formats as in an in-person session? Can you take advantage of the online format? Some conferences offer a Twitter chat as a format. You could also adopt a text interview or panel similar to AMA on Reddit or a moderated online chat. Collaborative document editing such as a Wikipedia editathon or an online documentation sprint are also an option.</li><li>Think about the virtual space. Do you just want to have a traditional website with lists of links or something that gives the impression of being in space. 3D virtual spaces like Second Life gave people more of a sense of space but they excluded those who found them difficult to navigate. In general, people have good shared mental models of a website and the benefits of a 3D emulation of the physical space are not certain. On the other hand, giving some thought to what should be visually placed together on the website can help make up for the lack of the most natural affordances of space.</li><li>Think about the medium and modality. Encourage presenters and participants to turn on videos and to attend from spaces that support that. But also encourage people to upload photos (or integrate with LinkedIn) to make the virtual space more personal and add more visual cues to the space.</li><li>Think about the amount of written text on the event website. Do participants arrive to what looks like a website or something that naturally suggests things happening. Don’t waste space with welcome messages or long descriptions. Even a welcome video just gets in the way. The first thing participants arriving to a website of a live online event should see is where to go next, how to join what is happening.</li><li>Think about having a chat channel that is constantly monitored by event organisers. Making the chat public is another possibility to enable others to learn from previous questions.</li></ol><h3>Communication and presentation</h3><ol><li>Have a central repository of information about the event with details of how to connect front and centre and promote that. Don’t rely on emails with links.</li><li>Have a status board on the front of the event website with what sessions are happening right now and what is coming next. Don’t rely on the schedule with links to sessions. Maybe even have a counter of how many people are in sessions at the moment and have a ticker of questions or chat being asked.</li><li>Allow participants to sign up for individual sessions and make sure that they can integrate it into their calendar and get individual email reminders. Just having a schedule they can click on doesn’t take into account their need to integrate the event into their life.</li><li>Think about having stable links to virtual rooms and give the rooms a name. There is some potential for confusion as people join the wrong session or come in for a session that’s still running but it will replicate some of the serendipity of a live event. Having unique links for each session has some technical advantages because presenters and facilitators can prepare ahead of time but if you build enough breaks between sessions, this could alleviate the problem.</li><li>Let participants promote the event in ways that is natural. Having an event hashtag for Twitter and Instagram is easy. But you should also have collateral to share. Have images that people can put on Instagram, offer a tweet of the day prize for the weeks running up to the conference. Reward blogging about the event, etc. You should also take the time and promote participants and presenters. Have a featured section on the website where you profile a scheduled talk every day or have event attendee write a short blog post about sessions they’re planning to attend and why.</li></ol><h3>Sessions</h3><ol><li>Each live session needs to have 2 roles for success. A session moderator and session technical support.</li><li>The moderator (chair) introduces the presenter, keeps track of time and then moderates the discussion. If there is a chat functionality, they should monitor and answer routine questions and collate questions for asking later. They could also interrupt the presenter if the question seems urgent. This could be a role taken on by the presenter themselves as it often is in live events but not all presenters will have the ability to monitor all aspects of the session. It is particularly useful to have a second person available when questions come in via text who can read them out.</li><li>The technical support person helps troubleshoot issues with microphones, screen sharing, or other technical use of the platform. They may also be responsible for starting the session (depending on the platform). The moderator can play this role if technically adept, or one technical support person can look after multiple sessions. But event organisers should expect the need for more technical support for online events. Often, these people will have nothing to do but their presence makes much more difference.</li><li>Panels and round tables work well in the virtual format and can be successful when moderated well. This does work best when all panelists’ videos are visible. Most platforms also have features for creating break out groups which may be an option for replicating the unconference format.</li><li>Lightning talks are becoming increasingly popular at events and these would be very easy to replicate online (although they don’t seem to be). A number of presenters simply pass screensharing and microphone control over and present short (3–7 min) talks. This can be moderated easily and be augmented by the presence of a text chat channel.</li><li>Not all sessions have to be in the form of a live presentation to an audience. Here are four suggestions for alternatives:</li><li>Having an AMA (Ask me anything) style Q&amp;A that was popularised by Reddit can be a powerful engagement. A presenter (usually somebody with a unique experience or point of view) can be available for a specified period of time (anywhere from an hour to week) to answer questions that people type in. This works best if the person is sufficiently known or the size of the audience is large to ensure questions are asked. The organisers may also substitute questions.</li><li>Group chat known from platforms such as Slack or Teams could replicate the experience of a live panel. An example of how this works is a moderated Slack discussion published by the website FiveThirtyEight. This could be organised live and / or published afterwards. But immediacy is important. This format requires a panel of people who are sufficiently acquainted with this form of communication and a competent moderator.</li><li>Twitter chat where participants follow a topic (using a hashtag) for a specified amount of time (usually an hour) has become an established group communication medium. Here all of the event’s virtual attendees can participate. These work best when moderated and require that participants use Twitter. By its nature, this happens in the public eye but could be replicated in a closed platform by open chat.</li><li>Editathon is another medium where a group works together on creating or editing a document on a single topic. These were popularised by Wikipedia but can be implemented easily using a shared Google Doc. Editathons can last anywhere from an hour to a week (when they are longer, they are also sometimes called book sprints but these are usually in person) and work best when people commit to them and have some system of communication and moderation.</li></ol><h3>Social environment</h3><p>Giving the online event a sense of cohesion (time and place) is perhaps the most difficult aspect to replicate. This is where the Second Life platform offered the most potential because it was possible to see representations of other people in the same space. But virtual environments with avatars are not as easy to navigate for everyone as a website so will ultimately reduce participation. Here are some suggestions based on what has been tried:</p><ol><li>A constantly open virtual room (cafe) where participants can join talk with each other. This should be constantly moderated so that somebody coming in at any time would always have someone to interact with. One way to promote this space would be to ask all presenters to spend at least 15 minutes there after the session to communicate.</li><li>Some conferences have tried to have a short (30 min) session at the start of each day and the end of each day to summarise key lessons, answer questions, and point to what will happen next. These need to be relevant and offer some reward to ensure attendance. Perhaps inviting select attendees to give a 3 minute summary of their highlights of the day could be a way to make it more popular.</li><li>Moderators of all sessions should always start with a summary of how the event is going and what sessions are coming up next (or running in parallel) .</li><li>A live ticker of how many people are in events or how many people are on the website and available to chat to could be integrated into the interface of the sessions.</li><li>A unified event chat running alongside the session chats (or instead) could make it easier for everyone to get a sense of the whole event. This would provide a bit of distraction but also bring the event together. This is replicated by a Twitter hashtag at most conferences. So one thing would be to integrate the Twitter stream directly into the session platform. This would work best when moderated.</li><li>Scheduled BoF (birds of a feather) sessions could also help attendees to meet and interact with like-minded participants. They could be organised around topic, region, or background and limited to 6–10 people per group. Again, some moderation or very clear rules of conduct would be necessary.</li><li>Some large virtual events have organised physical regional follow ups of participants from the same place. This could give people more of a sense of continuity but would only work for very large events.</li></ol><p>The reality of online events is that none of the above will work very successfully if not fully supported (and sometimes not even then). Organisers need to commit to the social aspects of the event and persevere even if there is no initial take up if just to reward the few people who do take part. It is also a good idea to have at least two or three modes of social interaction to give more of a chance for one to take off and to allow for the heterogeneity of the participants’ preferences.

It required a dedicated room and a technician on both ends, yet it seemed that an explosion of online teaching was just around the corner. But when I started a public lecture webinar series in 2010, online presentations were still a rarity. Now, webinars and virtual meetings are commonplace but we’re still not seeing a lot of entire events moving online. Even during the time of global lockdown and mass event cancelations, most events are simply cancelled even as teaching, meetings and music concerts move online. Why is that?</p><p>The common answer to the question of why we’re not running more online conferences goes along the lines of ‘people are social animals’ they need all the cues of face to face conversation, gestures, facial expression, etc. to communicate with each other. But I don’t think this is the case when it comes to transmitting information. Sitting in a lecture room and listening to someone does not give me any better cues than watching them on a video.</p><p>The other answer is ‘serendipity’. How about all the impromptu chats before and after sessions? Informal discussions over coffee or lunch? This is much closer to the real reason. But if this is the case, then the typical conference, tradeshow or even lecture is a really inefficient way of doing this. That’s why the Open Space Technology and later the unconference movement has tried to reinvent the event to focus away from presentations and more on interactions. But even then traditional conferences and tradeshows still predominate.</p><p>So, if the serendipity explanation only captures a part of the problem, what is the solution? I’d like to suggest that to understand why online events are not more common, we have to think about three types of affordances:</p><ol><li>Affordances of the space and time in which events take place</li><li>Affordances of physical interactions with objects</li><li>Affordances of social interaction such as scripts and scenarios</li></ol><p>Let’s look at these in more detail.</p><h3>Side note on affordances</h3><p>Affordances are a concept that’s leapt from ecological psychology to design to education technology discourse. The term is often used informally without much regard to the original research but I think we can benefit from a more rigorous analysis based on affordances. For my purpose here, I will think of affordances as the combination of the properties of our environment and our capabilities that allows us to interact with the world around us efficiently and without significant conscious effort.</p><h3>Affordances of time and space</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*29zt-6m7RaoPQ_Ci\" /></figure><p>Events are incredibly expensive to attend and to organise. They cost us money, time, and space. Yet, we feel they are worth it. We or our employers pay large registration fees, travel and hotel costs just to go to a place and listen to people talk. Why? I argue that the primary reason is the affordances of space.</p><p>These are partly what the ‘serendipity’ argument for in-person conferences alludes to. But it is much more than just chance encounters. The whole physical configuration of an event is working to make it seem like a natural environment for interaction. Rooms are configured obviously so that it is clear where one should sit and the idea of a group of people sitting in rows and watching someone speak seems so obvious it is beneath our notice.</p><p>It is not just the rooms in which the talks are taking place. It is also the spaces connecting them and the people in them. We see corridors through which we can walk and even follow other people. Some of these people are easily visually identified as helpers who we can ask questions. We can follow other people who look like they are going to a session, we can ask them, “are you also going to X” in a socially acceptable way. We see signs that direct us and receive printed materials that we can carry with us. We can judge whether a talk is popular at a glance by looking at how many people are in the room.</p><p>Why is any of this important? Isn’t it just trivially obvious? This is important precisely because all of the things I mentioned above are so obvious. They automatically present themselves to us for interactions and in that they remove much of the mental burden of deciding what to do.</p><p>Let’s compare it with an online event. Nothing about an online event offers these natural affordances. There are no rooms, corridors, posters on walls, or helpful people in the way. All attendees have a is a link somewhere in their Inbox. This is not a problem for an individual webinar. But a whole online event is much different. Each participant is forging a lonely path to the component events and meetings. Some carefully put them on their agendas, other just trawl their emails for the links or Google the website hoping to find the right time and place. It is not the lack of sociability that gets in their way, it is the lack of affordances.</p><p>Organisers of online events often underestimate this aspect of the event and only focus on the interactions between speakers and audiences, and not how they connect together. An online event then becomes a series of webinars that may or may not feel like they belong together.</p><p>But there is even more to it than that. We also need to think of the affordances of time and space from which the virtual attendees are taking part. They are often in their office or at their home which is full of affordances suggesting very different ways of natural interaction. They are most likely sitting at a desk with a headset on. Every cue in their environment is suggesting that they should be doing other things. Going to meetings, washing the dishes, talking with colleagues or family. By moving an event online we have not only removed the social space of the event itself, we have disrupted the social space from which the participant is attending.</p><p>Yet, even this is not all. The online attendee is not alone in the space from which they are dialling in. That space is filled with other people who are interacting enabled and encouraged by its affordances. To them, the online participant presents as a person watching a screen with a headset on. It is natural to go to them and ask something if necessary. And the online attendee feels not just the social pressure but the natural inclination driven by the environment to look away and pay attention to this request. This is even worse in between ‘sessions’ of this online event. In person, this is a time to process or take advantage of the space to interact with others. But the space and time the participant is attending from (be it home or office) forces other demands on them. The interactions it affords have nothing to do with the event.</p><p>This gives us the real answers to why people pay so much money to organise and attend events. They are buying the space and time which affords them the interaction with the least amount of effort. All of this feels so natural that describing it in detail seems like a waste of time. But I would argue that it is because we haven’t thought this through, that online events have not become more popular. It also explains why the problem is not solved by something that more closely replicates space in a virtual replica like Second Life. That only models the space of the event but does nothing for the space in which the participant finds themselves.</p><h3>Affordances of physical interactions: Skype vs phone</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9_LTf3gHvSk4W8kN\" /></figure><p>The popular video ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYu_bGbZiiQ\">Conference Calls in Real Life</a>’ by the comedians Tripp and Tyler illustrates perfectly the mismatch between the affordances of virtual and physical interactions. Again, these are all under the surface of our notice but make the experience of the virtual event very different form a physical one. A few simple things the video illustrates are:</p><ul><li>in a shared space, once somebody is present, they don’t suddenly disappear</li><li>it is immediately obvious to everybody in a space who else is in that space</li><li>the level of voice in the shared space is consistent for all participants</li><li>the attention of all participant in a shared space is shared</li><li>it is obvious to all participants when the event is over</li><li>speaking is managed only by the social conventions of taking turns without any other intervening channels</li><li>all participants have exactly the same ability to interact with all aspects of the shared environment (opening doors, sitting in chairs, putting things on desks, reviewing paper notes)</li></ul><p>None of these things are true of online events — even single meetings or webinars suffer from this but it is magnified for multi-session online gatherings. The above list is so trivially obvious that it would be quite difficult to compile it without the contrasting experience of online events.</p><p>We can blame some of this discrepancy on the reliability of technology but this is only a part of the problem. After all, physical spaces are not perfectly reliable themselves. External noise makes it difficult to hear, sunshine makes it hard to see, people come in late and have to leave early, participants’ attention wanders, speakers voice is not sufficiently amplified. The entire physical space could become unavailable because of double booking, lost keys, or a water leak.</p><p>But all of these physical reliability issues come with their own affordances that almost naturally present ways of dealing with them. We can tell people, let’s find another room if it’s locked or busy, we can even have a conversation right there. We can leave a sign on the door. If there’s external noise, we can pause until it goes away in a way that is obvious to everyone, and so on. Even technology issues in physical spaces like broken projectors, missing whiteboard markers, or lack of the right dongle have natural physical workarounds — we can just speak. They are all part of the affordances of physical spaces.</p><p>Issues with technology in virtual meetings are different because they are not shared by all the participants in the same way. When there is a sudden silence it is not clear whether it was because of a connection drop, accidental muting, or a natural pause. The same channel for communication such as a headset and microphone that was working an hour ago may become suddenly unavailable without any visual indication. All of these things have their own affordances but they are not shared, nor are they obviously in the environment. This means that they rely on the participant’s learned skill and appropriate mental models to work around. And in online events, these skills are always variable across the participants.</p><p>Over time, the technology is getting more and more reliable and more and more people are able to do basic troubleshooting. But its very nature means that there will always be a gap between the physical and digital affordances that we need to take into account.</p><p>One simple example that illustrates the problem is the simple matter of digital hand-raising. Most platforms offer a button with a hand that participants can push to raise their hand. But in all my years of running webinars, I have yet to see this work well. This has nothing to do with technology and all to do with affordances. The technology is trivial: push a button on the screen to indicate you’ve raised your hand. Anybody can do it provided, the button is in a place that can be easily discovered by the user.</p><p>But unlike with physical hand raising, the person raising the hand can easily forget that their hand is virtually raised. They often get the attention of the presenter, ask their question, get an answer, and yet their virtual hand is up. This means that after a while the presenter can no longer be sure that the ‘raised’ hands indicated on the interface mean a real question. In real life, a stretch is sometimes mistaken for a raised hand, but nobody keeps their hand up after they attracted the attention of the speaker. Also, the physically raised hand intrudes into the shared space, so others can draw the speaker’s attention to it. The virtual hand is easier to miss and ignore. It is also much easier to push the button without any physical or social consequence to the person doing it. And, of course, it can also be pushed by mistake.</p><p>So, as we can see, the affordances of physical interaction are another reason why many people would happily expend time and money to attend a real event, and why so many presenters prefer to present in person.</p><p>One reason that teachers like to give is that they much prefer face-to-face teaching is because they can adjust how they teach based on the facial expressions and other physical cues of the attendees. There is something to it. But in reality, most presenters are much worse at this than they think they are and they are much less able to adjust what they say than they hope. Having observed several hundred of such events (as organiser, attendee or even presenter), I would suggest that the ability to see facial expressions of participants is much less important than the other affordances I listed above. It is also one that is most easily fixed by technology and, unfortunately, the one technology providers most focus on.</p><p>We should avoid thinking of affordances as simply properties of the space. They only become affordances once we perceive them as being able to interact with them. And to make sense of affordances, we need to also think about the mental models we have to perceive them. Comparing the phone with online calling and video conferencing is instructive. Making a phone call has lost much of its physicality. We do “pick up” a handset but the “dialling” is most commonly tapping on a name. We may or may not hold it to our ear as we speak. Most importantly, the call is transmitted digitally over the network in the same way data is.</p><p>Yet, we have very physical mental models of phone calls. These are partly encoded in our vocabulary (pick up the call, dial, answer the call) and partly in image schemas (holding hand to ear to simulate — call me). Yet, none of those things are obvious physical properties of phones. They depend entirely on our mental models of what the physical object phone does and how it trasmits voice. These models include accounting for failure. ‘Hanging up accidentally’, ‘dropping out’, ‘poor connection’. These seem to be natural properties of phonecalls and while annoying, they are easily incorporated into the scripts through which we interpret what happens around us..</p><p>But even 20 years in, Skype (and its ilk) do not come with the same set of culturally shared models. Even after many years of using Skype and GoToMeeting at an organisation, these were still not perceived as easy to use as a phone. Even if the quality of the connection was often better than a phone, the social scripts around picking up a phone and calling someone are just too powerful. And while Skype, Zoom and others fail about as often as phone calls, their failures are interpreted as examples of them ‘not being as good or easy to use as phones’. There is a lot of nuance and complexity hidden here, but we must not forget that affordances always need to be considered in relation to their associated mental models.</p><p><strong>Side note: </strong>The last 2 paragraphs would be anathema to an ecological psychologist who likes to think of affordances as directly perceivable. And they have a point. But mental models are the only way we have of thinking about affordances of machines and digital objects, so I think we do much better with them in the mix.</p><h3>Social affordances: Scripts, routines and rituals</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*JJg-PKIB8Ai2_D6F\" /></figure><p>One more class of affordances that we need to take into account are social ones. Social affordances overlap with the physical affordances but they are more closely interwoven with the schemas and images that we share. These affordances are much more dependent on custom and convention, again much of it below the level of conscious awareness. Here the physical environment is only one of the participants in a complex network of social practices.</p><p>One such social affordance that has been most extensively studied by linguists and anthropologists is turn taking. We saw how the physical environment enables turn taking through offering a shared attention space. But there are many other conventions involved. Who speaks when, how a change of turn is signalled, how is turn taking regulated, and how is it repaired when the process breaks down. Many of the conventions of turn taking rely on physical space, so we have to develop new ways of managing this in a virtual environment.</p><p>We can see some of these issues with turn taking highlighted in the Tripp and Tyler video. But even in a setting where the presenter can see the faces of the participants on a large screen or a video wall, the lack of shared space may introduce subtle changes. For instance, one presenter complained that attendees don’t laugh at his jokes in the same way they do in physical classes. This is all to do with shared space. With laughter, we don’t react just to the funniness of the joke. We are also responding to the reactions of others, we’re signalling that we got the joke, and we’re giving feedback to the person telling the joke. Even if we don’t find it funny, we may smile politely to indicate acknowledgement. We laugh much less even when we watch a comedy routine alone than in the audience of a live performance. Attendees in a virtual session may find the joke just as funny as in person but they are not getting the same social signals to react outwardly.</p><p>As before, the social affordances don’t just apply to the act of participating in a session. They apply to the whole extended process involved in getting people to a conference. The very simplicity of being able to say to your colleagues or family something like “I’m going to a conference next week” or “I’m at a workshop all day that day” makes a lot of difference. Everybody knows a few things:</p><ul><li>You’re not available to talk or to call</li><li>You are travelling away (possibly overnight)</li><li>There is a cost of time and money involved</li><li>You are the sort of person in an organisation who goes to conferences (this is not something everybody does)</li></ul><p>It is also something your organisation understands. There are ways to build it into a calendar, there are established processes for payment and reimbursement. There is no local demand on space.</p><p>Attending an online event disrupts all of those scripts and routines. You are still present but not available in a way that we don’t have an established schema for. If somebody’s away at a conference, only the direst of emergencies will call them back. At worst, they may be required to check email or be called away to a phone call for urgent matters. The level of urgency is socially understood and naturally flows from the social configuration. But the threshold to asking somebody to perform a task who is simply sitting at their desk with a headset on is significantly lower. If attending from home, spouses or even more significantly children may be even less willing to acknowledge this.</p><p>We also have social schemas for interaction between sessions at a conference that are completely lacking when it is moved online. We have a sense of when to join a group, when to approach someone, etc. Not everybody feels the same level of comfort in these situations but they can at least fall back on established scripts. Sometimes, the rules of interaction are supported by a rule book or a charter. For instance, when organisers want to try a new approach (such as unconference) or change the culture (for instance, promote more gender equality). Session moderators also often agree with presenters on the best way of alerting them to time or taking questions. But even when these rules are in place, they are just added to existing schemas.</p><p>When we run an online event, we have to describe every single rule and procedure for interaction at a much lower level to make up for the lack of the social affordances developed for a certain time and space. What makes this even more difficult is that attendees have many fewer opportunities to observe the behaviour of others and adjust what they do. There is less opportunity for accidental learning. Something as trivial as seeing someone circling a session they want to attend on their agenda may give others ideas to do something similar. With online events, almost all of this happens away from public sight.</p><h3>Financial “affordances”: How (not) to pay for an online event</h3><p>I started by pointing out how expensive it is for participants to travel to a physical conference and how despite that the other affordances make it worth it. This is also helped by the associated mental models of what is valuable enough to exchange money for. And the mental model most associated with a conference or a tradeshow is that of a holiday — definitely for the people who tend to go to conferences. There is work associated with it but it’s also a break from work. For people whose attendance is covered by an institution, being able to attend events like conferences is a definite perk.</p><p>There are many people who have to pay to attend and may struggle to identify the resources which is why many events have bursaries and free spots. But usually not enough. So, physical conferences while great for building communities are also to some extent exclusionary — they’re for those on the inside and offer less opportunity to those on the outside. This is one thing that online communities are great at fixing. They allow outsiders to engage if they put in the work, or at least lurk and get a sense of what’s going on.</p><p>This is assuming that online communities are free to access. This may be a fair assumption for most text-based (and now increasingly image-based) online communities. But can this model also apply to virtual events? Which brings up to the other aspect of the financial “affordance” which is the cost of organizing a virtual event.</p><p>Our first reaction is that virtual events need no space and don’t have to serve food, so a large part of the cost disappears immediately. And that is absolutely true. The bulk of the cost of all the conferences and events I have ever organised was on room rental and food. There is also the cost of invited keynote speakers but that is usually minor when compared to the big fixed costs. In fact, most academic conferences just about break even or are even subsidized by the organizing institution. They are partly able to do this because they can harness the “free” labor of organizers and helpers (students), and can usually rely on some local institutional support.</p><p>But there is another class of event, usually put on by an association or some type of professional body for whom the annual event is a significant source of revenue — sometimes the main annual source of income. They often have much less access to free labour — they don’t have their own students — and they need to devote staff resource for several months who do nothing but work on the organizing the event. This is similar but on an even larger scale with commercial events such as trade shows who often make money by charging exhibitors rather than attendees.</p><p>So while the physical costs disappear, the organizational costs don’t. If anything (as described below), the virtual event needs more attention to every detail of presentation and communication. The communications about arrivals, accommodation and local facilities disappear but they are more than replaced by coordinating virtual work of the organising team, presenters and assistants. Nothing can be left to sort out on the day. The sort of thing that we can leave for the 15-minute check in before registration opens on the first day have to all be sorted out well in advance.</p><p>There is also the need to pay the technical provider for the video conferencing costs which is a relatively modest fixed cost but it does not scale infinitely. While with a physical event, there’s a natural limit imposed by the size of the venue, a virtual event is potentially unlimited but organisers have to estimate the attendance to decide on the level of subscription of the conference platform. Online events (particularly when they’re free) have huge drop out rates. For free webinars, it is pretty much the norm that only about 30% of the people who register actually attend. It is not clear whether this rate would be much lower or much higher with online events which are essentially a series of webinars.</p><p>In short, online events have a different cost structure but they are not free. We are in an environment where people are increasingly willing to pay not just for access to online resources but also for online experiences. Online events can tap into this but they cannot expect to charge the same. It is just not clear yet what the financial models of online events will turn out to be.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-platforms-strategies-and-challenges-97464cdc0f2a?sk=9e4809ee02ae5d51c7538f82abcc29b0\"><strong>Introduction</strong></a> &lt;&lt;Previous | Next&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-part-2-strategies-what-can-we-learn-from-successful-online-events-8ae2dbf40703?sk=632297047eef8329e3b5d74db3cc832d\"><strong>Part 2: Strategies</strong></a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a1b94533649c\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-part-1-challenges-why-are-not-more-events-taking-place-online-a1b94533649c\">Moving Events Online Part 1: Challenges: Why are not more events taking place online?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech\">TechCzech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

It required a dedicated room and a technician on both ends, yet it seemed that an explosion of online teaching was just around the corner. But when I started a public lecture webinar series in 2010, online presentations were still a rarity. Now, webinars and virtual meetings are commonplace but we’re still not seeing a lot of entire events moving online. Even during the time of global lockdown and mass event cancelations, most events are simply cancelled even as teaching, meetings and music concerts move online. Why is that?</p><p>The common answer to the question of why we’re not running more online conferences goes along the lines of ‘people are social animals’ they need all the cues of face to face conversation, gestures, facial expression, etc. to communicate with each other. But I don’t think this is the case when it comes to transmitting information. Sitting in a lecture room and listening to someone does not give me any better cues than watching them on a video.</p><p>The other answer is ‘serendipity’. How about all the impromptu chats before and after sessions? Informal discussions over coffee or lunch? This is much closer to the real reason. But if this is the case, then the typical conference, tradeshow or even lecture is a really inefficient way of doing this. That’s why the Open Space Technology and later the unconference movement has tried to reinvent the event to focus away from presentations and more on interactions. But even then traditional conferences and tradeshows still predominate.</p><p>So, if the serendipity explanation only captures a part of the problem, what is the solution? I’d like to suggest that to understand why online events are not more common, we have to think about three types of affordances:</p><ol><li>Affordances of the space and time in which events take place</li><li>Affordances of physical interactions with objects</li><li>Affordances of social interaction such as scripts and scenarios</li></ol><p>Let’s look at these in more detail.</p><h3>Side note on affordances</h3><p>Affordances are a concept that’s leapt from ecological psychology to design to education technology discourse. The term is often used informally without much regard to the original research but I think we can benefit from a more rigorous analysis based on affordances. For my purpose here, I will think of affordances as the combination of the properties of our environment and our capabilities that allows us to interact with the world around us efficiently and without significant conscious effort.</p><h3>Affordances of time and space</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*29zt-6m7RaoPQ_Ci\" /></figure><p>Events are incredibly expensive to attend and to organise. They cost us money, time, and space. Yet, we feel they are worth it. We or our employers pay large registration fees, travel and hotel costs just to go to a place and listen to people talk. Why? I argue that the primary reason is the affordances of space.</p><p>These are partly what the ‘serendipity’ argument for in-person conferences alludes to. But it is much more than just chance encounters. The whole physical configuration of an event is working to make it seem like a natural environment for interaction. Rooms are configured obviously so that it is clear where one should sit and the idea of a group of people sitting in rows and watching someone speak seems so obvious it is beneath our notice.</p><p>It is not just the rooms in which the talks are taking place. It is also the spaces connecting them and the people in them. We see corridors through which we can walk and even follow other people. Some of these people are easily visually identified as helpers who we can ask questions. We can follow other people who look like they are going to a session, we can ask them, “are you also going to X” in a socially acceptable way. We see signs that direct us and receive printed materials that we can carry with us. We can judge whether a talk is popular at a glance by looking at how many people are in the room.</p><p>Why is any of this important? Isn’t it just trivially obvious? This is important precisely because all of the things I mentioned above are so obvious. They automatically present themselves to us for interactions and in that they remove much of the mental burden of deciding what to do.</p><p>Let’s compare it with an online event. Nothing about an online event offers these natural affordances. There are no rooms, corridors, posters on walls, or helpful people in the way. All attendees have a is a link somewhere in their Inbox. This is not a problem for an individual webinar. But a whole online event is much different. Each participant is forging a lonely path to the component events and meetings. Some carefully put them on their agendas, other just trawl their emails for the links or Google the website hoping to find the right time and place. It is not the lack of sociability that gets in their way, it is the lack of affordances.</p><p>Organisers of online events often underestimate this aspect of the event and only focus on the interactions between speakers and audiences, and not how they connect together. An online event then becomes a series of webinars that may or may not feel like they belong together.</p><p>But there is even more to it than that. We also need to think of the affordances of time and space from which the virtual attendees are taking part. They are often in their office or at their home which is full of affordances suggesting very different ways of natural interaction. They are most likely sitting at a desk with a headset on. Every cue in their environment is suggesting that they should be doing other things. Going to meetings, washing the dishes, talking with colleagues or family. By moving an event online we have not only removed the social space of the event itself, we have disrupted the social space from which the participant is attending.</p><p>Yet, even this is not all. The online attendee is not alone in the space from which they are dialling in. That space is filled with other people who are interacting enabled and encouraged by its affordances. To them, the online participant presents as a person watching a screen with a headset on. It is natural to go to them and ask something if necessary. And the online attendee feels not just the social pressure but the natural inclination driven by the environment to look away and pay attention to this request. This is even worse in between ‘sessions’ of this online event. In person, this is a time to process or take advantage of the space to interact with others. But the space and time the participant is attending from (be it home or office) forces other demands on them. The interactions it affords have nothing to do with the event.</p><p>This gives us the real answers to why people pay so much money to organise and attend events. They are buying the space and time which affords them the interaction with the least amount of effort. All of this feels so natural that describing it in detail seems like a waste of time. But I would argue that it is because we haven’t thought this through, that online events have not become more popular. It also explains why the problem is not solved by something that more closely replicates space in a virtual replica like Second Life. That only models the space of the event but does nothing for the space in which the participant finds themselves.</p><h3>Affordances of physical interactions: Skype vs phone</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9_LTf3gHvSk4W8kN\" /></figure><p>The popular video ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYu_bGbZiiQ\">Conference Calls in Real Life</a>’ by the comedians Tripp and Tyler illustrates perfectly the mismatch between the affordances of virtual and physical interactions.

A few simple things the video illustrates are:</p><ul><li>in a shared space, once somebody is present, they don’t suddenly disappear</li><li>it is immediately obvious to everybody in a space who else is in that space</li><li>the level of voice in the shared space is consistent for all participants</li><li>the attention of all participant in a shared space is shared</li><li>it is obvious to all participants when the event is over</li><li>speaking is managed only by the social conventions of taking turns without any other intervening channels</li><li>all participants have exactly the same ability to interact with all aspects of the shared environment (opening doors, sitting in chairs, putting things on desks, reviewing paper notes)</li></ul><p>None of these things are true of online events — even single meetings or webinars suffer from this but it is magnified for multi-session online gatherings. The above list is so trivially obvious that it would be quite difficult to compile it without the contrasting experience of online events.</p><p>We can blame some of this discrepancy on the reliability of technology but this is only a part of the problem. After all, physical spaces are not perfectly reliable themselves. External noise makes it difficult to hear, sunshine makes it hard to see, people come in late and have to leave early, participants’ attention wanders, speakers voice is not sufficiently amplified. The entire physical space could become unavailable because of double booking, lost keys, or a water leak.</p><p>But all of these physical reliability issues come with their own affordances that almost naturally present ways of dealing with them. We can tell people, let’s find another room if it’s locked or busy, we can even have a conversation right there. We can leave a sign on the door. If there’s external noise, we can pause until it goes away in a way that is obvious to everyone, and so on. Even technology issues in physical spaces like broken projectors, missing whiteboard markers, or lack of the right dongle have natural physical workarounds — we can just speak. They are all part of the affordances of physical spaces.</p><p>Issues with technology in virtual meetings are different because they are not shared by all the participants in the same way. When there is a sudden silence it is not clear whether it was because of a connection drop, accidental muting, or a natural pause. The same channel for communication such as a headset and microphone that was working an hour ago may become suddenly unavailable without any visual indication. All of these things have their own affordances but they are not shared, nor are they obviously in the environment. This means that they rely on the participant’s learned skill and appropriate mental models to work around. And in online events, these skills are always variable across the participants.</p><p>Over time, the technology is getting more and more reliable and more and more people are able to do basic troubleshooting. But its very nature means that there will always be a gap between the physical and digital affordances that we need to take into account.</p><p>One simple example that illustrates the problem is the simple matter of digital hand-raising. Most platforms offer a button with a hand that participants can push to raise their hand. But in all my years of running webinars, I have yet to see this work well. This has nothing to do with technology and all to do with affordances. The technology is trivial: push a button on the screen to indicate you’ve raised your hand. Anybody can do it provided, the button is in a place that can be easily discovered by the user.</p><p>But unlike with physical hand raising, the person raising the hand can easily forget that their hand is virtually raised. They often get the attention of the presenter, ask their question, get an answer, and yet their virtual hand is up. This means that after a while the presenter can no longer be sure that the ‘raised’ hands indicated on the interface mean a real question. In real life, a stretch is sometimes mistaken for a raised hand, but nobody keeps their hand up after they attracted the attention of the speaker. Also, the physically raised hand intrudes into the shared space, so others can draw the speaker’s attention to it. The virtual hand is easier to miss and ignore. It is also much easier to push the button without any physical or social consequence to the person doing it. And, of course, it can also be pushed by mistake.</p><p>So, as we can see, the affordances of physical interaction are another reason why many people would happily expend time and money to attend a real event, and why so many presenters prefer to present in person.</p><p>One reason that teachers like to give is that they much prefer face-to-face teaching is because they can adjust how they teach based on the facial expressions and other physical cues of the attendees. There is something to it. But in reality, most presenters are much worse at this than they think they are and they are much less able to adjust what they say than they hope. Having observed several hundred of such events (as organiser, attendee or even presenter), I would suggest that the ability to see facial expressions of participants is much less important than the other affordances I listed above. It is also one that is most easily fixed by technology and, unfortunately, the one technology providers most focus on.</p><p>We should avoid thinking of affordances as simply properties of the space. They only become affordances once we perceive them as being able to interact with them. And to make sense of affordances, we need to also think about the mental models we have to perceive them. Comparing the phone with online calling and video conferencing is instructive. Making a phone call has lost much of its physicality. We do “pick up” a handset but the “dialling” is most commonly tapping on a name. We may or may not hold it to our ear as we speak. Most importantly, the call is transmitted digitally over the network in the same way data is.</p><p>Yet, we have very physical mental models of phone calls. These are partly encoded in our vocabulary (pick up the call, dial, answer the call) and partly in image schemas (holding hand to ear to simulate — call me). Yet, none of those things are obvious physical properties of phones. They depend entirely on our mental models of what the physical object phone does and how it trasmits voice. These models include accounting for failure. ‘Hanging up accidentally’, ‘dropping out’, ‘poor connection’. These seem to be natural properties of phonecalls and while annoying, they are easily incorporated into the scripts through which we interpret what happens around us..</p><p>But even 20 years in, Skype (and its ilk) do not come with the same set of culturally shared models. Even after many years of using Skype and GoToMeeting at an organisation, these were still not perceived as easy to use as a phone. Even if the quality of the connection was often better than a phone, the social scripts around picking up a phone and calling someone are just too powerful. And while Skype, Zoom and others fail about as often as phone calls, their failures are interpreted as examples of them ‘not being as good or easy to use as phones’. There is a lot of nuance and complexity hidden here, but we must not forget that affordances always need to be considered in relation to their associated mental models.</p><p><strong>Side note: </strong>The last 2 paragraphs would be anathema to an ecological psychologist who likes to think of affordances as directly perceivable. And they have a point. But mental models are the only way we have of thinking about affordances of machines and digital objects, so I think we do much better with them in the mix.</p><h3>Social affordances: Scripts, routines and rituals</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*JJg-PKIB8Ai2_D6F\" /></figure><p>One more class of affordances that we need to take into account are social ones. Social affordances overlap with the physical affordances but they are more closely interwoven with the schemas and images that we share. These affordances are much more dependent on custom and convention, again much of it below the level of conscious awareness. Here the physical environment is only one of the participants in a complex network of social practices.</p><p>One such social affordance that has been most extensively studied by linguists and anthropologists is turn taking. We saw how the physical environment enables turn taking through offering a shared attention space. But there are many other conventions involved. Who speaks when, how a change of turn is signalled, how is turn taking regulated, and how is it repaired when the process breaks down. Many of the conventions of turn taking rely on physical space, so we have to develop new ways of managing this in a virtual environment.</p><p>We can see some of these issues with turn taking highlighted in the Tripp and Tyler video. But even in a setting where the presenter can see the faces of the participants on a large screen or a video wall, the lack of shared space may introduce subtle changes. For instance, one presenter complained that attendees don’t laugh at his jokes in the same way they do in physical classes. This is all to do with shared space. With laughter, we don’t react just to the funniness of the joke. We are also responding to the reactions of others, we’re signalling that we got the joke, and we’re giving feedback to the person telling the joke. Even if we don’t find it funny, we may smile politely to indicate acknowledgement. We laugh much less even when we watch a comedy routine alone than in the audience of a live performance. Attendees in a virtual session may find the joke just as funny as in person but they are not getting the same social signals to react outwardly.</p><p>As before, the social affordances don’t just apply to the act of participating in a session. They apply to the whole extended process involved in getting people to a conference. The very simplicity of being able to say to your colleagues or family something like “I’m going to a conference next week” or “I’m at a workshop all day that day” makes a lot of difference. Everybody knows a few things:</p><ul><li>You’re not available to talk or to call</li><li>You are travelling away (possibly overnight)</li><li>There is a cost of time and money involved</li><li>You are the sort of person in an organisation who goes to conferences (this is not something everybody does)</li></ul><p>It is also something your organisation understands. There are ways to build it into a calendar, there are established processes for payment and reimbursement. There is no local demand on space.</p><p>Attending an online event disrupts all of those scripts and routines. You are still present but not available in a way that we don’t have an established schema for. If somebody’s away at a conference, only the direst of emergencies will call them back. At worst, they may be required to check email or be called away to a phone call for urgent matters. The level of urgency is socially understood and naturally flows from the social configuration. But the threshold to asking somebody to perform a task who is simply sitting at their desk with a headset on is significantly lower. If attending from home, spouses or even more significantly children may be even less willing to acknowledge this.</p><p>We also have social schemas for interaction between sessions at a conference that are completely lacking when it is moved online. We have a sense of when to join a group, when to approach someone, etc. Not everybody feels the same level of comfort in these situations but they can at least fall back on established scripts. Sometimes, the rules of interaction are supported by a rule book or a charter. For instance, when organisers want to try a new approach (such as unconference) or change the culture (for instance, promote more gender equality). Session moderators also often agree with presenters on the best way of alerting them to time or taking questions. But even when these rules are in place, they are just added to existing schemas.</p><p>When we run an online event, we have to describe every single rule and procedure for interaction at a much lower level to make up for the lack of the social affordances developed for a certain time and space. What makes this even more difficult is that attendees have many fewer opportunities to observe the behaviour of others and adjust what they do. There is less opportunity for accidental learning. Something as trivial as seeing someone circling a session they want to attend on their agenda may give others ideas to do something similar. With online events, almost all of this happens away from public sight.</p><h3>Financial “affordances”: How (not) to pay for an online event</h3><p>I started by pointing out how expensive it is for participants to travel to a physical conference and how despite that the other affordances make it worth it. This is also helped by the associated mental models of what is valuable enough to exchange money for. And the mental model most associated with a conference or a tradeshow is that of a holiday — definitely for the people who tend to go to conferences. There is work associated with it but it’s also a break from work. For people whose attendance is covered by an institution, being able to attend events like conferences is a definite perk.</p><p>There are many people who have to pay to attend and may struggle to identify the resources which is why many events have bursaries and free spots. But usually not enough. So, physical conferences while great for building communities are also to some extent exclusionary — they’re for those on the inside and offer less opportunity to those on the outside. This is one thing that online communities are great at fixing. They allow outsiders to engage if they put in the work, or at least lurk and get a sense of what’s going on.</p><p>This is assuming that online communities are free to access. This may be a fair assumption for most text-based (and now increasingly image-based) online communities. But can this model also apply to virtual events? Which brings up to the other aspect of the financial “affordance” which is the cost of organizing a virtual event.</p><p>Our first reaction is that virtual events need no space and don’t have to serve food, so a large part of the cost disappears immediately. And that is absolutely true. The bulk of the cost of all the conferences and events I have ever organised was on room rental and food. There is also the cost of invited keynote speakers but that is usually minor when compared to the big fixed costs. In fact, most academic conferences just about break even or are even subsidized by the organizing institution. They are partly able to do this because they can harness the “free” labor of organizers and helpers (students), and can usually rely on some local institutional support.</p><p>But there is another class of event, usually put on by an association or some type of professional body for whom the annual event is a significant source of revenue — sometimes the main annual source of income. They often have much less access to free labour — they don’t have their own students — and they need to devote staff resource for several months who do nothing but work on the organizing the event. This is similar but on an even larger scale with commercial events such as trade shows who often make money by charging exhibitors rather than attendees.</p><p>So while the physical costs disappear, the organizational costs don’t. If anything (as described below), the virtual event needs more attention to every detail of presentation and communication. The communications about arrivals, accommodation and local facilities disappear but they are more than replaced by coordinating virtual work of the organising team, presenters and assistants. Nothing can be left to sort out on the day. The sort of thing that we can leave for the 15-minute check in before registration opens on the first day have to all be sorted out well in advance.</p><p>There is also the need to pay the technical provider for the video conferencing costs which is a relatively modest fixed cost but it does not scale infinitely. While with a physical event, there’s a natural limit imposed by the size of the venue, a virtual event is potentially unlimited but organisers have to estimate the attendance to decide on the level of subscription of the conference platform. Online events (particularly when they’re free) have huge drop out rates. For free webinars, it is pretty much the norm that only about 30% of the people who register actually attend. It is not clear whether this rate would be much lower or much higher with online events which are essentially a series of webinars.</p><p>In short, online events have a different cost structure but they are not free. We are in an environment where people are increasingly willing to pay not just for access to online resources but also for online experiences. Online events can tap into this but they cannot expect to charge the same. It is just not clear yet what the financial models of online events will turn out to be.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-platforms-strategies-and-challenges-97464cdc0f2a?sk=9e4809ee02ae5d51c7538f82abcc29b0\"><strong>Introduction</strong></a> &lt;&lt;Previous | Next&gt;&gt; <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-part-2-strategies-what-can-we-learn-from-successful-online-events-8ae2dbf40703?sk=632297047eef8329e3b5d74db3cc832d\"><strong>Part 2: Strategies</strong></a></p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a1b94533649c\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/moving-events-online-part-1-challenges-why-are-not-more-events-taking-place-online-a1b94533649c\">Moving Events Online Part 1: Challenges: Why are not more events taking place online?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech\">TechCzech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

But all these advances are going to be much more boring than we imagine. The world of tech will look more the same than different. I predict:</p><ol><li>No fully autonomous self-driving cars</li><li>No general-purpose robots for home or garden</li><li>No tablets fully replacing laptops or laptops replacing desktops or ereaders replacing books</li><li>No blockchain powered national currencies</li><li>Still no smart fridges that know what’s in them and automatically order food for us</li></ol><p>But on the plus side, we can probably expect:</p><ol><li>More ubiquitous and cheaper connectivity to a more compartmentalised internet</li><li>Longer-lasting batteries in smartphones and laptops</li><li>Better smartwatches that don’t have to be charged every day</li><li>Smarter cars that will park themselves reliably</li><li>Smarter homes that will manage heating, lights and key appliances efficiently and reliably</li></ol><h3>What the world needs now: Batteries</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfHAs9cdTqg\">What the world needs now</a> is <a href=\"https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/showdown-hydrogen-vs-battery/\">more efficient energy storage</a>. If there is one thing that could completely transform the world we live in it is a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2019/press-release/\">battery</a> (be it in the form of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell\">fuel cell</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercapacitor\">supercapacitor</a> or something else) that can power a smartphone or a laptop for a week, fits in small spaces, charges almost instantaneously, does not explode easily, can be manufactured cheaply, uses abundant materials and can be recharged tens of thousands of times. Above all, it would make carbon reduction so much easier — solar and wind energy could be used more readily, electric cars would have fewer tradeoffs, etc. But in the world of tech, the windows for innovation in many areas would just explode open: wearable tech for one — smart watches, smart glasses, smart rings, … All of those things are available today but their usefulness is hampered by short battery life. What good are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses\">smart glasses</a> that only last an hour?</p><p>My prediction is that we will not have such battery tech by the end of the next decade. I fervently hope to be wrong. But more likely, energy storage has the same in store for us as any other industrially mature technology from cars or aeroplanes to computer microprocessors. Boring, incremental improvements along various axes — not all of them noticeable. But incremental improvements add up — we can now get more out of our batteries that at <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/30/battery-developments-in-the-last-decade-created-a-seismic-shift-that-will-play-out-in-the-next-10-years.html\">the start of the decade</a> — even if much of that improvement came from more power-efficient processors and other energy saving tricks. People like Elon Musk are betting on <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-battery-energy-density-improves-5-8-per-year-Does-this-represent-an-average-or-is-it-a-consistent-trend-each-year-Do-these-improvements-increase-the-cost-What-has-been-the-trend-if-any-regarding-energy-to-weight-ratio\">batteries improving by about 7% a year</a>. That means that battery capacity would almost double by 2030 from what it is today. But there is no law here. We could make <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/gadgets/news/130380-future-batteries-coming-soon-charge-in-seconds-last-months-and-power-over-the-air\">bigger leaps</a> or grind to a halt. But if I were a billionaire, I’d fund open battery research alongside <a href=\"https://www.who.int/malaria/media/malaria-vaccine-implementation-qa/en/\">malaria</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0307_CISA_EMP-Protection-Resilience-Guidelines.pdf\">EMP-readiness</a>.</p><h3>5G and more accessible mobile networking</h3><p>In 2001, I spent a year in Prague when the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service\">GPRS</a> (2G) on my phone was my only internet connection. It was fine for email and the occasional web-search — not much of a downgrade on a dial-up. Then, there was a long period when the landline was far superior to any mobile connection. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)\">LTE</a> (or 4G) changed all that. When the signal is plentiful and the needs are typical, you may not even notice you’re not connected to your local WiFi. What then can we expect from the future? Lower prices and unlimited data caps would be a good start — if <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/03/05/the-cost-of-mobile-internet-around-the-world-infographic/#6fb9bc39226e\">not a certainty</a>.</p><p>When it comes to a more connected future, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/the-terrifying-potential-of-the-5g-network\">5G is getting a lot of press</a>. But it probably won’t be until much closer to 2030 before we can tell whether it’s had the impact people are expecting. I don’t have any strong feelings about this either way but I’d certainly <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-5g/\">not say no</a> to more devices always connected to the internet and each other in more places with less latency. If 5G could replace local broadband and we could get always connected laptops, I’d say that’s a future worth having.</p><h3>LED Monitors and the foldable display</h3><p>The 2010s were a time of display evolution. But they evolved into being pretty awesome. While <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-does-3-D-TV-failed-to-live-up-to-its-expectations\">3D failed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avsforum.com/forum/40-oled-technology-flat-panels-general/2080650-10-reasons-plasma-died.html\">plasma died</a> a quiet death, high resolution (4K) and deep colour (HDR) displays became the norm on TVs, phones and even computer screens. But there’s also some tech on the horizon that hints at more revolutionary changes than that.</p><p>Imagine a world where almost any surface can be a screen. Any bit of a wall and even a roll up screen. Two different technologies are making their first appearance that may make this happen. They are LED displays and foldable displays.</p><p>2019 saw its <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bensin/2019/07/29/review-the-worlds-first-foldable-phone-is-surprisingly-usable/\">first foldable phone</a> to wide acclaim of <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/opinions/samsung-galaxy-fold-best-phone-of-2019/\">potential</a> but flexible displays have been making slow inroads for a <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/galaxy-edge-series-review-4124395\">while</a>. Foldable tablets and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020/01/07/lg-display-is-cramming-curved-and-bendable-screens-into-every-pa/\">more</a> are being announced left and right — will we ever get to a place where we can just take a think display and roll it up like a newspaper? Possibly not but being able to fold a large iPad in half would be more than enough. I can certainly see that as a possibility by 2030. The underlying tech works in principle but still needs some engineering to be completely ready for the mass market. 10 years sounds like a reasonable time-frame to make something of it.</p><p>Much less flashy but with no less potential is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroLED\">MicroLED display</a>. Almost any new TV will use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode\">LED</a> as its light source. But the image instead shows up on a thin layer of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film-transistor_liquid-crystal_display\">transistors</a> (or <a href=\"https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/oled.htm\">something like that</a>) through which the light shines. MicroLED displays, on the other hand, don’t have a single source of light. Instead, they consist of a lot of tiny LED lights that can display lots of colours. That may not sound that exciting, because display tech changes all the time, but what this enables is to have much smaller thin display squares that can be seamlessly combined into huge surfaces of any shape — even discontinuous. They will consume less energy, weigh less, and each segment can receive different signal at the hardware level. At the moment, they’re still more expensive than traditional displays and need to overcome other difficulties but the potential for having a corner display that follows the shape of a corner can open up new ways of designing interactive public spaces.</p><h3>Struggle for control and regulation</h3><p>“<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free\">Information wants to be free</a>” was the rallying cry of the Internet pioneers in the 1980s. The <a href=\"https://www.cluetrain.com/\">cluetrain manifesto</a> in the 1990s talked of markets as conversations and about the time of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring\">Arab Spring</a>, the Internet was seen as a vehicle of ever expanding freedom. But at the same time, the unregulated nature of the internet was running into conflict with the regulated nature of the world, the internet was more and more interwoven with.</p><p>China started building the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall\">Great Firewall</a> in the late 1990s but it was only in the 2010s that it became more pervasive and impactful. Many governments in the Middle East also started experimenting with various controls and limits on expression. Russia has also started asserting more control over what goes on in its virtual borders. This is not necessarily only related to online activities, both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astra_Linux\">Russia</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylin_(operating_system)\">China </a>are also developing their own operating systems that could run on the computers they want to control. Russia decided to kick off the new decade by a <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/95564/security/russia-runet-tests.html\">successful test of RUnet</a> — a version of the internet disconnected from the rest of the world.</p><p>This is not limited to countries with a reputation for more central control of individual freedoms. The US government is waging a battle over encryption with providers of communication platforms, as is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/australia-encryption-law-global-impact/\">Australia</a> and UK. The EU implemented regulations like the ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten\">right to be forgotten</a>’ and <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\">GDPR</a> which ostensibly protect the individual but limit the internet. At the same time, it is promoting <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/europes-copyright-law-could-change-the-web/\">new copyright regulations</a> that would severely limit the ability to share information online. All of these efforts were met with opposition — sometimes <a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/dead-upload-day-youtube-made-for-kids-coppa/\">more</a>, at other times <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party\">less </a>successful.</p><p>Based on all this, I feel pretty secure in making the prediction that the next decade will be defined by more efforts by governments to assert more control over the internet. Be it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/19/elizabeth-warren-facebook-break-up\">regulation</a> of companies like Facebook or Google or efforts to install <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614003/trumps-justice-department-calls-for-encryption-backdoor-law/\">backdoors in encryption</a>. And it is also safe to assume that new technologies will continue to be developed to <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">subvert</a> this effort. Sometimes this effort will be laughably doomed to failure like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/16/uk-drops-plans-for-online-pornography-age-verification-system\">UK’s effort to limit access to pornography</a>. Sometimes, it will be more sophisticated such as the Chinese efforts. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/best-vpn-services-2020-directory/\">VPNs</a> will almost certainly continue to boom in the 2020s and will be coming up with more and more inventive ways of avoiding detection. My money is on the governments being more (but not completely) successful in their efforts for control but also that the consequences of these efforts will be less dire than predicted. (Although, they may be pointlessly annoying like the stupid <a href=\"https://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/\">EU cookie law</a>.)</p><h3>Adventures in automation</h3><p>So far, <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/about/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab\">The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)</a> has been a bigger business for the gurus than anybody else. True, more and more modern production factories are clean, quiet places — far removed from the noise and dirt I remember when I did my work experience stints in a car parts manufacturing machining department in the 1980s. It takes many fewer people to build a car than it did a few decades ago. But much of this is due to process refinement that makes the people involved more productive and assisted by clever, single-purpose machines. There’s no such thing as a general-purpose robot arm (let alone a robot) or general purpose <a href=\"https://medium.com/metaphor-hacker/learning-vs-training-in-machines-and-organizations-production-of-knowledge-vs-production-of-f1f9e6c1d9f3\">intelligent software that could manage it all</a>. And car companies can still be much more more efficient without fully automating as <a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/article/20180123/OEM01/180129910/why-assembly-plants-need-people-more-than-robots\">Tesla learned to its cost</a>.</p><p>We already saw that fully self-driving cars are probably much farther into the future and that AI may or may not live up to its hype. We are just too happy to extrapolate from initial successes to science fiction. This is not new. Flying cars, nuclear reactors heating the home, robots having <a href=\"https://gfycat.com/dangerousgrotesquegerenuk\">intelligent conversations with us</a> — all of these were predictions built on the assumption that we can safely extrapolate from early successes. We just never know exactly what the next step will bring and when complexity will hit us in the face. We could truly be at the start of a revolution, or we could be just having a very good start to building a ladder to the moon.</p><p>My suspicion is that the complexity of most of the problems automation is supposed to resolve is just too high. Over Christmas, I tried to set up a lot of routines to tie together a lot of my smart devices with my daily rituals. It took a lot of time and it was only a partial success — even my simple needs are too complicated for Google Assistant without a lot of manual set up by me. <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\">IFTTT</a>, <a href=\"https://zapier.com/\">Zapier</a> and <a href=\"https://flow.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Flow</a> (now PowerAutomate) have introduced a lot of automation into our online lives but the complexity of the processes they handle can increase exponentially. I’ve used all these services and they make many processes easier. Everytime I highlight a bit of text in an article I’m reading in Pocket, it gets saved to Evernote. But the success is always limited by my ability to conceive of the processes to be automated and integrate them into my life.</p><p>The fear is that very soon almost <a href=\"https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/\">all jobs will be automated away</a>. That is almost certainly not going to happen over the next 10 years. There will be areas where wonderful advances will reshape parts of our lives, but I predict that their overall shape will still be recognisable and not all that different from 2010.</p><h3>Smart spaces</h3><p>Much of the technology we take for granted only exists thanks to a quiet revolution that started in the 2000s. It is the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100332\">revolution in sensor design</a>: gyroscopes, proximity sensors, accelerometers, ambient light sensors, and more. These sensors are cheap, small and can send digital signals to a processor. They are what made the <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/sensors-that-make-iphone-so-cool-2000370\">iPhone possible</a> and much of the technology we take for granted would not be possible without them. The big question is what is the next step?</p><p>Smart devices, smart rooms, smart homes and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city\">smart cities</a> — those are all things people dream about. They dream of cars that talk to each other and the road that tells them how to turn. Cars that can travel closer to each other at higher speeds because they can communicate with each other. Or shops without any assistants. You just walk in, take what you need and the shop knows what you took, will charge your card and order new stock. And how about a home that knows you’re near, will start the heating, turn on the lights depending on the time of day, open its door when it sees you, and so on. And why not a smart city — while we’re at it? A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fbd70da-05a7-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca\">city that knows</a> where there’s trash on the ground, where to turn the lights on, where there’s congestion, where to send the cleaning crew and where to send the police.</p><p>Some components of this future already exist. There are offices that know whether a room that was booked was also used. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Go\">Amazon</a> and others are experimenting with shops that don’t require any staff. Smart thermostats and smart blinds are also something people can have in their home. Smart cities are being experimented with. So, what can we expect in 2030? Probably a lot less than we imagine. Some new things will become common-place — maybe it will be smart locks or drone deliveries. Maybe it will be something not yet on the horizon. But it will be slower and less all encompassing than we imagine.</p><p>One thing that the 2010s brought into our lives is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-checkout\">self-service check-out till</a> in supermarkets. That is a change some people love and others hate but it is instructive in what can be done. First, self-checkouts are only possible because of a sophisticated technological infrastructure — the shops does not only have to have accurate stock but also have more information in the database about product weight, special offers, etc. The self-checkout machines themselves have to have very accurate sensors for weight and fairly reliable barcode readers. But the self-check out mostly depends on people learning how to do simple tasks guided by an interface. It is as much a social framing change as it is a technological change. And when it comes to smart spaces, they will always have to have a social component — and only those changes that can be accommodated by people will be the ones that will be part of the overall shape our lives in 2030.</p><h3>Technical debt ebbs and flows: IPv6, ARM transition and more</h3><p>“Nothing hides problems like success” is my favorite phrase I learned by listening to the <a href=\"https://5by5.tv/hypercritical\">Hypercritical podcast</a> with <a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/\">John Siracusa</a>. Apple, Microsoft, Google and many others are hugely successful — their products are popular, sell well and their stock is riding high. This makes them reluctant to tinker with core aspects of their operations. Why fix something that is not broken, or worse, why risk accidentally breaking something that is essential to that success.</p><p>This is how companies accumulate what is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt\">technical debt</a>. Slowly, all the little shortcuts and hacks done to make something work add up so that making a small change becomes almost impossible without having to rebuild the entire system. Every successful technological company has a mountain of technical debt and they constantly have to juggle it around. But the same goes for entire countries whose existing infrastructure is tied to a certain way of doing things — and making small sensible changes becomes very expensive and time-consuming.</p><p>The US was a pioneer in the use of credit cards and the entire country’s infrastructure is built around payments with cards. But it was built around the old less secure and now less convenient magnetic strip cards. The <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/us-determined-to-have-the-least-secure-credit-cards-in-the-world/473199/\">transition to chip and pin</a> and then contactless payments is taking much longer than in other countries precisely because the technical debt was too high. The reason for this is that the system grew organically and has too many interconnected parts that cannot be blocked off during the transition. At the same time, it performs its central function reasonably well, so the motivation to move to a better system is less than if it were irreparably broken.</p><p>You can see another manifestation of technical debt every time you try to open an advanced control panel in Microsoft Windows 10. In 2012, Microsoft released Windows 8 which introduced a new approach for managing the operating system settings. It had a new visual esthetic, it was in a more unified interface and focused on important settings first. The new control panels were a usability improvement. But Microsoft only had time to change the most important settings and it took only about a click to get to the old interface dating back to Windows XP (or even 95). Eight years later in 2020, the process still isn’t finished and it’s not clear it <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/293858/windows-10s-settings-are-a-mess-and-microsoft-doesnt-seem-to-care/\">ever will be</a>. There are just too many corners of the operating system — some of them can only be called by using the command line — to get to them all. And this is a relatively mild case of debt because it does not stop Microsoft from going further in a fundamental way — but it gets in the way. The company is right now experiencing a similar issue with moving to a new (and much better) approach to Sharepoint (not something most people will experience).</p><p>There are countless examples of technical debt all around us. Much of the innovation in the next decade will therefore not only have to deal with solving specific problems, it will also have to deal with the technical debt of the world around it.</p><p>Some of this technical debt goes back to the foundations of the internet. For example, the world has <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/04/18/last_ipv4_address/\">pretty much</a> run out of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4\">IPv4</a> addresses (unique number that must be assigned to any device connected to the internet). There were only about 4.3 billion addresses available in the first place — which is obviously not enough because there an order of magnitude more devices in the world. The only reason the Internet still works is something called NAT (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation\">Net Address Translation</a>) — which puts a bunch of devices behind a device that sends out requests to the internet and then passes them on. That’s what your home or corporate internet router or modem do. They also have the advantage as acting as essentially a firewall which is why it is a lot safer to connect to the internet this way than directly. But there are now not enough addresses even for NAT.</p><p>Everybody knew about this problem back in the 1990s. Which why <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6\">IPv6</a> was introduced in 1998 with a practically infinite number of addresses — enough to put every grain of sand on Earth online. But even by then IPv4 was so widespread and baked into hardware that was powering essential infrastructure and the switch would have required coordination on a global scale and cost trillions. So instead, the world is slowly transitioning (through a lot of effort and coordination) — but even today the <a href=\"https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/2018/state-of-ipv6-deployment-2018/\">majority of internet traffic</a> (and all on home wifi) is over IPv4 which was introduced in 1983. Over the next decade the transition will continue. It will not be in the headlines or even noticeable to users. But it will be a subtle drag on other innovation as important resources are diverted and some of the smartest engineers on the planet are occupied with this rather than something else.</p><p>Much of the next decade will also be dealing with technical debt connected to security. The Internet was designed without any security in mind. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System\">DNS (Domain Name System)</a> — the system that translates IP addresses into human-readable domain names — is completely insecure and easily subverted. Without it typing <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">www.google.com</a> in the browser address bar would do nothing — the web would cease to exist. So many slow upgrades and changes to it are <a href=\"https://medium.com/@andrecamillo/the-current-state-and-the-future-of-dns-security-2019-4a9590296d26\">being proposed</a> and much of the next decade will focus on dealing with this.</p><p>Another security legacy is the system of usernames and passwords. It is clunky and a major source of breaches at all levels. We’ve already seen a great growth in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication\">‘second factor authentication</a>’ over the last decade — something the bank does everytime it sends you a code in an SMS message (which has <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/12/06/2fa_missed_warning/\">its own problems</a>). The push to replace or augment passwords will continue over the next 10 years. It will be slow and incomplete but I predict that by 2030, we will have better, more secure ways of logging in. I’d like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQRL\">SQRL</a> to succeed but most likely, we will be faced with a portfolio of authentication methods that will still include passwords in one way or another.</p><p>One more technical area that will probably define the next decade is the transition to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture\">ARM architecture</a> in the processors that power computers. ARM-based processors are more energy efficient and have other advantages over Intel’s architecture. The smartphone and IoT world started out with ARM and showed the way. But all desktops and laptops run on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86\">Intel x86 architecture</a>. This would not be a problem if we didn’t want our devices to have longer battery life. The 2010s were filled with rumors of <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-on-arm-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-buy-a-surface-pro-x/\">Windows on ARM</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-RT-32GB-Renewed/dp/B00LUXSAO4\">first attempt was a disaster</a>. The problem is that software written for one type of processor don’t work on the other without some (sometimes significant) reengineering. But the latest <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20887386/microsoft-surface-event-pro-7-arm-windows-laptops\">Windows on ARM devices</a> are much better and the rumors that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/arm-macs/\">Apple is switching to ARM</a> are growing stronger. So it is inevitable that much of the 2020s will be consumed with efforts in this direction. Unlike, IPv6, this will have a direct effect on the kind of devices users can buy but it will also require a lot of effort to be spent on dealing with the technical debt accumulated over the last 20 years of software development.</p><h3>Socialising change and paying down the UX debt</h3><p>Like technical debt, the much less-well known <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-debt/\">UX (user experience) debt</a>, is usually applied to individual products or companies. But an entire industry can also accumulate UX debt. It comes in the form of typical user expectations and socialised skills. To learn to use an interface, users have invested a lot of learning effort. This is not just personal learning but also learning from others and learning who in their sphere of friends and acquaintances can help them. So often even interfaces and methods that are more efficient to use end up being slow to catch on. And this gets in the way of innovation in product design and makes revolutionary changes rare.</p><p>Some interfaces like windows and files in folders are so entrenched that moving to better ones is a slow process. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things\">Designers</a> (inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_psychology\">psychology</a>) often talk about affordances — how the objects or interfaces present themselves to us for interaction. But digital objects don’t really have all that many ‘natural’ affordances in the same way that a mug has a handle. So, they need to be learned and when it comes to large-scale change socialised.</p><p>Often, when we’re at the crest of the innovation wave in some area, everybody who’s using a new technology and is excited about it, has already internalised all the affordances. And it is hard for them to imagine how they are not naturally obvious to everybody. For example, what could be more natural than interacting with objects on the screen with touch? Yet, there’s nothing intrinsically obvious about the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/30/3279628/apple-pinch-to-zoom-patent-myth\">pinch-to-zoom</a> gesture popularised by the iPhone. That’s why much of <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2013/03/29/six-years-ago-apple-made-a-crowd-gasp-with-pinch-to-zoom-and-swiping/\">Apple’s advertising featured people pinching and zooming</a>.</p><p>When Microsoft rolled out Windows 8, it completely redesigned all the key affordances with a focus on touch. It introduced a really useful and clever swipe from edge feature (if you had a touch screen). But it did nothing to socialise the feature, which gave us videos, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/13/windows-8-pirillo\">like this</a>, of people who would sit in front of a computer and not be able to do anything with it until somebody explained to them. Windows 8 was a usability disaster not because it was hard to use but because it required relearning. And this was not supported by efforts to socialise the new way of doing things. Apple recently replaced the hardware button (an affordance so completely socialised that it feels natural) with a <a href=\"https://www.abilitynet.org.uk/news-blogs/no-home-button-new-iphone-here-secret-going-completely-button-free\">swipe up gesture</a>. Exactly the same change — but supported by massive advertising efforts, conversations, as well as useful on-boarding of users. And it was successful.</p><p>Sometimes a change is so easily learnable that any user can figure it out on its own. I’ve noticed a recent change in calendars used by online booking services. It used to be that this required 2 interactions (and it is still common) — but the best have now converted to first click being the start date and second click end or return date. Nothing in the interface signals that but the outcome makes it clear what happens and no user is confused. But such a change is rare. Most of the time, change takes a long time to become ‘natural’ and to change the shapes of our inner scripts and scenarios.</p><p>Whatever the next decade brings to change our lives, it will include a lot of learning, relearning, conversation and bafflement. All of the big transformations I listed for the 2010s are trailing behind them a thick long tail of people who still haven’t been socialised to them. People, who save their files only on a USB stick without an online backup, people who still don’t like touch. People who haven’t figured out how to incorporate audiobooks or podcasts into their lives. People who still print out everything they read. And so on. That is to be expected and not all of it is bad. But this is our social user-experience debt. The 2020s will definitely bring new things but much of the effort will have to be spent on socialising the changes brought by the 2010s.</p><h3>In praise of a boring future</h3><p>It is the new and unusual that generates news headlines. But I’m more excited about the boring and every-day change that is cheap, easy to use and available to as many people as possible. That’s why I am most looking forward to innovations in product design, manufacturing and commoditization. I remember spending a lot of time agonizing over the specs of my computer, now I know that anything at a certain price will fit my needs. Any camera, smartphone, office software will work out of the box and match my core needs. Sure, productivity experts will still pore over spec sheets and make many painful compromises about the gear they buy. But that is fine, that’s how progress is made. Typical users will not have to care.</p><p>On the surface, trains, planes and automobiles look very much the same and perform their core functions in the same way they did 50 years ago. Because they are more subject to fads and fashions, cars have changed the most in their outward appearance, but their speed and mode of operation has not altered much. If you sample the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Chronicles\">Computer Chronicles</a> (now <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ComputerChroniclesYT\">available on YouTube</a>) between 1982 and 1997, you will see dramatic changes in the way computers looked and work. But relatively little has changed since then in the overall shape of things that was not incremental. Phones underwent a similar transformation in the 15 years roughly between 1997 till 2012. But now the changes are much harder to perceive at any remove. Social networking was in great flux between 2000 and 2015 but nothing much new will surprise us in this field in the future. There are only so many shapes to be explored and while there will be change, it won’t be as radical. And so on.</p><p>I love all the little improvements and changes tech makes in my life and <a href=\"http://digiknow.sbsblogs.co.uk/2020/01/06/digiknow-sessions-for-hilary-2020-accessibility-clarity-and-learning-productivity/\">try my best</a> to help other people take advantage of them. But it’s important to be realistic and wait for things to settle before declaring that everything is New Again. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times\">Luckily</a>, it almost never is.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b2688e0049d4\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/predictions-for-the-next-decade-hopes-dreams-and-reality-checks-part-6-of-tech-that-reshaped-b2688e0049d4\">Predictions for the next decade: Hopes, dreams and reality checks: Part 6 of Tech That Reshaped…</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech\">TechCzech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

But all these advances are going to be much more boring than we imagine. The world of tech will look more the same than different. I predict:</p><ol><li>No fully autonomous self-driving cars</li><li>No general-purpose robots for home or garden</li><li>No tablets fully replacing laptops or laptops replacing desktops or ereaders replacing books</li><li>No blockchain powered national currencies</li><li>Still no smart fridges that know what’s in them and automatically order food for us</li></ol><p>But on the plus side, we can probably expect:</p><ol><li>More ubiquitous and cheaper connectivity to a more compartmentalised internet</li><li>Longer-lasting batteries in smartphones and laptops</li><li>Better smartwatches that don’t have to be charged every day</li><li>Smarter cars that will park themselves reliably</li><li>Smarter homes that will manage heating, lights and key appliances efficiently and reliably</li></ol><h3>What the world needs now: Batteries</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfHAs9cdTqg\">What the world needs now</a> is <a href=\"https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/showdown-hydrogen-vs-battery/\">more efficient energy storage</a>. If there is one thing that could completely transform the world we live in it is a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2019/press-release/\">battery</a> (be it in the form of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell\">fuel cell</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercapacitor\">supercapacitor</a> or something else) that can power a smartphone or a laptop for a week, fits in small spaces, charges almost instantaneously, does not explode easily, can be manufactured cheaply, uses abundant materials and can be recharged tens of thousands of times. Above all, it would make carbon reduction so much easier — solar and wind energy could be used more readily, electric cars would have fewer tradeoffs, etc. But in the world of tech, the windows for innovation in many areas would just explode open: wearable tech for one — smart watches, smart glasses, smart rings, … All of those things are available today but their usefulness is hampered by short battery life. What good are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartglasses\">smart glasses</a> that only last an hour?</p><p>My prediction is that we will not have such battery tech by the end of the next decade. I fervently hope to be wrong. But more likely, energy storage has the same in store for us as any other industrially mature technology from cars or aeroplanes to computer microprocessors. Boring, incremental improvements along various axes — not all of them noticeable. But incremental improvements add up — we can now get more out of our batteries that at <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/30/battery-developments-in-the-last-decade-created-a-seismic-shift-that-will-play-out-in-the-next-10-years.html\">the start of the decade</a> — even if much of that improvement came from more power-efficient processors and other energy saving tricks. People like Elon Musk are betting on <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-battery-energy-density-improves-5-8-per-year-Does-this-represent-an-average-or-is-it-a-consistent-trend-each-year-Do-these-improvements-increase-the-cost-What-has-been-the-trend-if-any-regarding-energy-to-weight-ratio\">batteries improving by about 7% a year</a>. That means that battery capacity would almost double by 2030 from what it is today. But there is no law here. We could make <a href=\"https://www.pocket-lint.com/gadgets/news/130380-future-batteries-coming-soon-charge-in-seconds-last-months-and-power-over-the-air\">bigger leaps</a> or grind to a halt. But if I were a billionaire, I’d fund open battery research alongside <a href=\"https://www.who.int/malaria/media/malaria-vaccine-implementation-qa/en/\">malaria</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0307_CISA_EMP-Protection-Resilience-Guidelines.pdf\">EMP-readiness</a>.</p><h3>5G and more accessible mobile networking</h3><p>In 2001, I spent a year in Prague when the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service\">GPRS</a> (2G) on my phone was my only internet connection. It was fine for email and the occasional web-search — not much of a downgrade on a dial-up. Then, there was a long period when the landline was far superior to any mobile connection. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)\">LTE</a> (or 4G) changed all that. When the signal is plentiful and the needs are typical, you may not even notice you’re not connected to your local WiFi. What then can we expect from the future? Lower prices and unlimited data caps would be a good start — if <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/03/05/the-cost-of-mobile-internet-around-the-world-infographic/#6fb9bc39226e\">not a certainty</a>.</p><p>When it comes to a more connected future, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/the-terrifying-potential-of-the-5g-network\">5G is getting a lot of press</a>. But it probably won’t be until much closer to 2030 before we can tell whether it’s had the impact people are expecting. I don’t have any strong feelings about this either way but I’d certainly <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-5g/\">not say no</a> to more devices always connected to the internet and each other in more places with less latency. If 5G could replace local broadband and we could get always connected laptops, I’d say that’s a future worth having.</p><h3>LED Monitors and the foldable display</h3><p>The 2010s were a time of display evolution. But they evolved into being pretty awesome. While <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-does-3-D-TV-failed-to-live-up-to-its-expectations\">3D failed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.avsforum.com/forum/40-oled-technology-flat-panels-general/2080650-10-reasons-plasma-died.html\">plasma died</a> a quiet death, high resolution (4K) and deep colour (HDR) displays became the norm on TVs, phones and even computer screens. But there’s also some tech on the horizon that hints at more revolutionary changes than that.</p><p>Imagine a world where almost any surface can be a screen. Any bit of a wall and even a roll up screen. Two different technologies are making their first appearance that may make this happen. They are LED displays and foldable displays.</p><p>2019 saw its <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bensin/2019/07/29/review-the-worlds-first-foldable-phone-is-surprisingly-usable/\">first foldable phone</a> to wide acclaim of <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/opinions/samsung-galaxy-fold-best-phone-of-2019/\">potential</a> but flexible displays have been making slow inroads for a <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/galaxy-edge-series-review-4124395\">while</a>. Foldable tablets and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020/01/07/lg-display-is-cramming-curved-and-bendable-screens-into-every-pa/\">more</a> are being announced left and right — will we ever get to a place where we can just take a think display and roll it up like a newspaper? Possibly not but being able to fold a large iPad in half would be more than enough. I can certainly see that as a possibility by 2030. The underlying tech works in principle but still needs some engineering to be completely ready for the mass market. 10 years sounds like a reasonable time-frame to make something of it.</p><p>Much less flashy but with no less potential is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroLED\">MicroLED display</a>. Almost any new TV will use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode\">LED</a> as its light source. But the image instead shows up on a thin layer of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film-transistor_liquid-crystal_display\">transistors</a> (or <a href=\"https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/oled.htm\">something like that</a>) through which the light shines. MicroLED displays, on the other hand, don’t have a single source of light. Instead, they consist of a lot of tiny LED lights that can display lots of colours. That may not sound that exciting, because display tech changes all the time, but what this enables is to have much smaller thin display squares that can be seamlessly combined into huge surfaces of any shape — even discontinuous. They will consume less energy, weigh less, and each segment can receive different signal at the hardware level. At the moment, they’re still more expensive than traditional displays and need to overcome other difficulties but the potential for having a corner display that follows the shape of a corner can open up new ways of designing interactive public spaces.</p><h3>Struggle for control and regulation</h3><p>“<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free\">Information wants to be free</a>” was the rallying cry of the Internet pioneers in the 1980s. The <a href=\"https://www.cluetrain.com/\">cluetrain manifesto</a> in the 1990s talked of markets as conversations and about the time of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring\">Arab Spring</a>, the Internet was seen as a vehicle of ever expanding freedom. But at the same time, the unregulated nature of the internet was running into conflict with the regulated nature of the world, the internet was more and more interwoven with.</p><p>China started building the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall\">Great Firewall</a> in the late 1990s but it was only in the 2010s that it became more pervasive and impactful. Many governments in the Middle East also started experimenting with various controls and limits on expression. Russia has also started asserting more control over what goes on in its virtual borders. This is not necessarily only related to online activities, both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astra_Linux\">Russia</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylin_(operating_system)\">China </a>are also developing their own operating systems that could run on the computers they want to control. Russia decided to kick off the new decade by a <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/95564/security/russia-runet-tests.html\">successful test of RUnet</a> — a version of the internet disconnected from the rest of the world.</p><p>This is not limited to countries with a reputation for more central control of individual freedoms. The US government is waging a battle over encryption with providers of communication platforms, as is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/australia-encryption-law-global-impact/\">Australia</a> and UK. The EU implemented regulations like the ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten\">right to be forgotten</a>’ and <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\">GDPR</a> which ostensibly protect the individual but limit the internet. At the same time, it is promoting <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/europes-copyright-law-could-change-the-web/\">new copyright regulations</a> that would severely limit the ability to share information online. All of these efforts were met with opposition — sometimes <a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/dead-upload-day-youtube-made-for-kids-coppa/\">more</a>, at other times <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party\">less </a>successful.</p><p>Based on all this, I feel pretty secure in making the prediction that the next decade will be defined by more efforts by governments to assert more control over the internet. Be it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/19/elizabeth-warren-facebook-break-up\">regulation</a> of companies like Facebook or Google or efforts to install <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614003/trumps-justice-department-calls-for-encryption-backdoor-law/\">backdoors in encryption</a>. And it is also safe to assume that new technologies will continue to be developed to <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">subvert</a> this effort. Sometimes this effort will be laughably doomed to failure like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/16/uk-drops-plans-for-online-pornography-age-verification-system\">UK’s effort to limit access to pornography</a>. Sometimes, it will be more sophisticated such as the Chinese efforts. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/best-vpn-services-2020-directory/\">VPNs</a> will almost certainly continue to boom in the 2020s and will be coming up with more and more inventive ways of avoiding detection. My money is on the governments being more (but not completely) successful in their efforts for control but also that the consequences of these efforts will be less dire than predicted. (Although, they may be pointlessly annoying like the stupid <a href=\"https://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/\">EU cookie law</a>.)</p><h3>Adventures in automation</h3><p>So far, <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/about/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-by-klaus-schwab\">The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)</a> has been a bigger business for the gurus than anybody else. True, more and more modern production factories are clean, quiet places — far removed from the noise and dirt I remember when I did my work experience stints in a car parts manufacturing machining department in the 1980s. It takes many fewer people to build a car than it did a few decades ago. But much of this is due to process refinement that makes the people involved more productive and assisted by clever, single-purpose machines. There’s no such thing as a general-purpose robot arm (let alone a robot) or general purpose <a href=\"https://medium.com/metaphor-hacker/learning-vs-training-in-machines-and-organizations-production-of-knowledge-vs-production-of-f1f9e6c1d9f3\">intelligent software that could manage it all</a>. And car companies can still be much more more efficient without fully automating as <a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/article/20180123/OEM01/180129910/why-assembly-plants-need-people-more-than-robots\">Tesla learned to its cost</a>.</p><p>We already saw that fully self-driving cars are probably much farther into the future and that AI may or may not live up to its hype. We are just too happy to extrapolate from initial successes to science fiction. This is not new. Flying cars, nuclear reactors heating the home, robots having <a href=\"https://gfycat.com/dangerousgrotesquegerenuk\">intelligent conversations with us</a> — all of these were predictions built on the assumption that we can safely extrapolate from early successes. We just never know exactly what the next step will bring and when complexity will hit us in the face. We could truly be at the start of a revolution, or we could be just having a very good start to building a ladder to the moon.</p><p>My suspicion is that the complexity of most of the problems automation is supposed to resolve is just too high. Over Christmas, I tried to set up a lot of routines to tie together a lot of my smart devices with my daily rituals. It took a lot of time and it was only a partial success — even my simple needs are too complicated for Google Assistant without a lot of manual set up by me. <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\">IFTTT</a>, <a href=\"https://zapier.com/\">Zapier</a> and <a href=\"https://flow.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Flow</a> (now PowerAutomate) have introduced a lot of automation into our online lives but the complexity of the processes they handle can increase exponentially. I’ve used all these services and they make many processes easier. Everytime I highlight a bit of text in an article I’m reading in Pocket, it gets saved to Evernote. But the success is always limited by my ability to conceive of the processes to be automated and integrate them into my life.</p><p>The fear is that very soon almost <a href=\"https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/\">all jobs will be automated away</a>. That is almost certainly not going to happen over the next 10 years. There will be areas where wonderful advances will reshape parts of our lives, but I predict that their overall shape will still be recognisable and not all that different from 2010.</p><h3>Smart spaces</h3><p>Much of the technology we take for granted only exists thanks to a quiet revolution that started in the 2000s. It is the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100332\">revolution in sensor design</a>: gyroscopes, proximity sensors, accelerometers, ambient light sensors, and more. These sensors are cheap, small and can send digital signals to a processor. They are what made the <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/sensors-that-make-iphone-so-cool-2000370\">iPhone possible</a> and much of the technology we take for granted would not be possible without them. The big question is what is the next step?</p><p>Smart devices, smart rooms, smart homes and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city\">smart cities</a> — those are all things people dream about. They dream of cars that talk to each other and the road that tells them how to turn. Cars that can travel closer to each other at higher speeds because they can communicate with each other. Or shops without any assistants. You just walk in, take what you need and the shop knows what you took, will charge your card and order new stock. And how about a home that knows you’re near, will start the heating, turn on the lights depending on the time of day, open its door when it sees you, and so on. And why not a smart city — while we’re at it? A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fbd70da-05a7-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca\">city that knows</a> where there’s trash on the ground, where to turn the lights on, where there’s congestion, where to send the cleaning crew and where to send the police.</p><p>Some components of this future already exist. There are offices that know whether a room that was booked was also used. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Go\">Amazon</a> and others are experimenting with shops that don’t require any staff. Smart thermostats and smart blinds are also something people can have in their home. Smart cities are being experimented with. So, what can we expect in 2030? Probably a lot less than we imagine. Some new things will become common-place — maybe it will be smart locks or drone deliveries. Maybe it will be something not yet on the horizon. But it will be slower and less all encompassing than we imagine.</p><p>One thing that the 2010s brought into our lives is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-checkout\">self-service check-out till</a> in supermarkets. That is a change some people love and others hate but it is instructive in what can be done. First, self-checkouts are only possible because of a sophisticated technological infrastructure — the shops does not only have to have accurate stock but also have more information in the database about product weight, special offers, etc. The self-checkout machines themselves have to have very accurate sensors for weight and fairly reliable barcode readers. But the self-check out mostly depends on people learning how to do simple tasks guided by an interface. It is as much a social framing change as it is a technological change. And when it comes to smart spaces, they will always have to have a social component — and only those changes that can be accommodated by people will be the ones that will be part of the overall shape our lives in 2030.</p><h3>Technical debt ebbs and flows: IPv6, ARM transition and more</h3><p>“Nothing hides problems like success” is my favorite phrase I learned by listening to the <a href=\"https://5by5.tv/hypercritical\">Hypercritical podcast</a> with <a href=\"http://hypercritical.co/\">John Siracusa</a>. Apple, Microsoft, Google and many others are hugely successful — their products are popular, sell well and their stock is riding high. This makes them reluctant to tinker with core aspects of their operations. Why fix something that is not broken, or worse, why risk accidentally breaking something that is essential to that success.</p><p>This is how companies accumulate what is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt\">technical debt</a>. Slowly, all the little shortcuts and hacks done to make something work add up so that making a small change becomes almost impossible without having to rebuild the entire system. Every successful technological company has a mountain of technical debt and they constantly have to juggle it around. But the same goes for entire countries whose existing infrastructure is tied to a certain way of doing things — and making small sensible changes becomes very expensive and time-consuming.</p><p>The US was a pioneer in the use of credit cards and the entire country’s infrastructure is built around payments with cards. But it was built around the old less secure and now less convenient magnetic strip cards. The <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/us-determined-to-have-the-least-secure-credit-cards-in-the-world/473199/\">transition to chip and pin</a> and then contactless payments is taking much longer than in other countries precisely because the technical debt was too high. The reason for this is that the system grew organically and has too many interconnected parts that cannot be blocked off during the transition. At the same time, it performs its central function reasonably well, so the motivation to move to a better system is less than if it were irreparably broken.</p><p>You can see another manifestation of technical debt every time you try to open an advanced control panel in Microsoft Windows 10. In 2012, Microsoft released Windows 8 which introduced a new approach for managing the operating system settings. It had a new visual esthetic, it was in a more unified interface and focused on important settings first. The new control panels were a usability improvement. But Microsoft only had time to change the most important settings and it took only about a click to get to the old interface dating back to Windows XP (or even 95). Eight years later in 2020, the process still isn’t finished and it’s not clear it <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/293858/windows-10s-settings-are-a-mess-and-microsoft-doesnt-seem-to-care/\">ever will be</a>. There are just too many corners of the operating system — some of them can only be called by using the command line — to get to them all. And this is a relatively mild case of debt because it does not stop Microsoft from going further in a fundamental way — but it gets in the way. The company is right now experiencing a similar issue with moving to a new (and much better) approach to Sharepoint (not something most people will experience).</p><p>There are countless examples of technical debt all around us. Much of the innovation in the next decade will therefore not only have to deal with solving specific problems, it will also have to deal with the technical debt of the world around it.</p><p>Some of this technical debt goes back to the foundations of the internet. For example, the world has <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/04/18/last_ipv4_address/\">pretty much</a> run out of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4\">IPv4</a> addresses (unique number that must be assigned to any device connected to the internet). There were only about 4.3 billion addresses available in the first place — which is obviously not enough because there an order of magnitude more devices in the world. The only reason the Internet still works is something called NAT (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation\">Net Address Translation</a>) — which puts a bunch of devices behind a device that sends out requests to the internet and then passes them on. That’s what your home or corporate internet router or modem do. They also have the advantage as acting as essentially a firewall which is why it is a lot safer to connect to the internet this way than directly. But there are now not enough addresses even for NAT.</p><p>Everybody knew about this problem back in the 1990s. Which why <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6\">IPv6</a> was introduced in 1998 with a practically infinite number of addresses — enough to put every grain of sand on Earth online. But even by then IPv4 was so widespread and baked into hardware that was powering essential infrastructure and the switch would have required coordination on a global scale and cost trillions. So instead, the world is slowly transitioning (through a lot of effort and coordination) — but even today the <a href=\"https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/2018/state-of-ipv6-deployment-2018/\">majority of internet traffic</a> (and all on home wifi) is over IPv4 which was introduced in 1983. Over the next decade the transition will continue. It will not be in the headlines or even noticeable to users. But it will be a subtle drag on other innovation as important resources are diverted and some of the smartest engineers on the planet are occupied with this rather than something else.</p><p>Much of the next decade will also be dealing with technical debt connected to security. The Internet was designed without any security in mind. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System\">DNS (Domain Name System)</a> — the system that translates IP addresses into human-readable domain names — is completely insecure and easily subverted. Without it typing <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">www.google.com</a> in the browser address bar would do nothing — the web would cease to exist. So many slow upgrades and changes to it are <a href=\"https://medium.com/@andrecamillo/the-current-state-and-the-future-of-dns-security-2019-4a9590296d26\">being proposed</a> and much of the next decade will focus on dealing with this.</p><p>Another security legacy is the system of usernames and passwords. It is clunky and a major source of breaches at all levels. We’ve already seen a great growth in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication\">‘second factor authentication</a>’ over the last decade — something the bank does everytime it sends you a code in an SMS message (which has <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/12/06/2fa_missed_warning/\">its own problems</a>). The push to replace or augment passwords will continue over the next 10 years. It will be slow and incomplete but I predict that by 2030, we will have better, more secure ways of logging in. I’d like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQRL\">SQRL</a> to succeed but most likely, we will be faced with a portfolio of authentication methods that will still include passwords in one way or another.</p><p>One more technical area that will probably define the next decade is the transition to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture\">ARM architecture</a> in the processors that power computers. ARM-based processors are more energy efficient and have other advantages over Intel’s architecture. The smartphone and IoT world started out with ARM and showed the way. But all desktops and laptops run on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86\">Intel x86 architecture</a>. This would not be a problem if we didn’t want our devices to have longer battery life. The 2010s were filled with rumors of <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-on-arm-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-buy-a-surface-pro-x/\">Windows on ARM</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-RT-32GB-Renewed/dp/B00LUXSAO4\">first attempt was a disaster</a>. The problem is that software written for one type of processor don’t work on the other without some (sometimes significant) reengineering. But the latest <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20887386/microsoft-surface-event-pro-7-arm-windows-laptops\">Windows on ARM devices</a> are much better and the rumors that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/arm-macs/\">Apple is switching to ARM</a> are growing stronger. So it is inevitable that much of the 2020s will be consumed with efforts in this direction. Unlike, IPv6, this will have a direct effect on the kind of devices users can buy but it will also require a lot of effort to be spent on dealing with the technical debt accumulated over the last 20 years of software development.</p><h3>Socialising change and paying down the UX debt</h3><p>Like technical debt, the much less-well known <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-debt/\">UX (user experience) debt</a>, is usually applied to individual products or companies. But an entire industry can also accumulate UX debt. It comes in the form of typical user expectations and socialised skills. To learn to use an interface, users have invested a lot of learning effort. This is not just personal learning but also learning from others and learning who in their sphere of friends and acquaintances can help them. So often even interfaces and methods that are more efficient to use end up being slow to catch on. And this gets in the way of innovation in product design and makes revolutionary changes rare.</p><p>Some interfaces like windows and files in folders are so entrenched that moving to better ones is a slow process. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things\">Designers</a> (inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_psychology\">psychology</a>) often talk about affordances — how the objects or interfaces present themselves to us for interaction. But digital objects don’t really have all that many ‘natural’ affordances in the same way that a mug has a handle. So, they need to be learned and when it comes to large-scale change socialised.</p><p>Often, when we’re at the crest of the innovation wave in some area, everybody who’s using a new technology and is excited about it, has already internalised all the affordances. And it is hard for them to imagine how they are not naturally obvious to everybody. For example, what could be more natural than interacting with objects on the screen with touch? Yet, there’s nothing intrinsically obvious about the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/30/3279628/apple-pinch-to-zoom-patent-myth\">pinch-to-zoom</a> gesture popularised by the iPhone. That’s why much of <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2013/03/29/six-years-ago-apple-made-a-crowd-gasp-with-pinch-to-zoom-and-swiping/\">Apple’s advertising featured people pinching and zooming</a>.</p><p>When Microsoft rolled out Windows 8, it completely redesigned all the key affordances with a focus on touch. It introduced a really useful and clever swipe from edge feature (if you had a touch screen). But it did nothing to socialise the feature, which gave us videos, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/13/windows-8-pirillo\">like this</a>, of people who would sit in front of a computer and not be able to do anything with it until somebody explained to them. Windows 8 was a usability disaster not because it was hard to use but because it required relearning. And this was not supported by efforts to socialise the new way of doing things. Apple recently replaced the hardware button (an affordance so completely socialised that it feels natural) with a <a href=\"https://www.abilitynet.org.uk/news-blogs/no-home-button-new-iphone-here-secret-going-completely-button-free\">swipe up gesture</a>. Exactly the same change — but supported by massive advertising efforts, conversations, as well as useful on-boarding of users. And it was successful.</p><p>Sometimes a change is so easily learnable that any user can figure it out on its own. I’ve noticed a recent change in calendars used by online booking services. It used to be that this required 2 interactions (and it is still common) — but the best have now converted to first click being the start date and second click end or return date. Nothing in the interface signals that but the outcome makes it clear what happens and no user is confused. But such a change is rare. Most of the time, change takes a long time to become ‘natural’ and to change the shapes of our inner scripts and scenarios.</p><p>Whatever the next decade brings to change our lives, it will include a lot of learning, relearning, conversation and bafflement. All of the big transformations I listed for the 2010s are trailing behind them a thick long tail of people who still haven’t been socialised to them. People, who save their files only on a USB stick without an online backup, people who still don’t like touch. People who haven’t figured out how to incorporate audiobooks or podcasts into their lives. People who still print out everything they read. And so on. That is to be expected and not all of it is bad. But this is our social user-experience debt. The 2020s will definitely bring new things but much of the effort will have to be spent on socialising the changes brought by the 2010s.</p><h3>In praise of a boring future</h3><p>It is the new and unusual that generates news headlines. But I’m more excited about the boring and every-day change that is cheap, easy to use and available to as many people as possible. That’s why I am most looking forward to innovations in product design, manufacturing and commoditization. I remember spending a lot of time agonizing over the specs of my computer, now I know that anything at a certain price will fit my needs. Any camera, smartphone, office software will work out of the box and match my core needs. Sure, productivity experts will still pore over spec sheets and make many painful compromises about the gear they buy. But that is fine, that’s how progress is made. Typical users will not have to care.</p><p>On the surface, trains, planes and automobiles look very much the same and perform their core functions in the same way they did 50 years ago. Because they are more subject to fads and fashions, cars have changed the most in their outward appearance, but their speed and mode of operation has not altered much. If you sample the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Chronicles\">Computer Chronicles</a> (now <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ComputerChroniclesYT\">available on YouTube</a>) between 1982 and 1997, you will see dramatic changes in the way computers looked and work. But relatively little has changed since then in the overall shape of things that was not incremental. Phones underwent a similar transformation in the 15 years roughly between 1997 till 2012. But now the changes are much harder to perceive at any remove. Social networking was in great flux between 2000 and 2015 but nothing much new will surprise us in this field in the future. There are only so many shapes to be explored and while there will be change, it won’t be as radical. And so on.</p><p>I love all the little improvements and changes tech makes in my life and <a href=\"http://digiknow.sbsblogs.co.uk/2020/01/06/digiknow-sessions-for-hilary-2020-accessibility-clarity-and-learning-productivity/\">try my best</a> to help other people take advantage of them. But it’s important to be realistic and wait for things to settle before declaring that everything is New Again. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times\">Luckily</a>, it almost never is.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b2688e0049d4\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/predictions-for-the-next-decade-hopes-dreams-and-reality-checks-part-6-of-tech-that-reshaped-b2688e0049d4\">Predictions for the next decade: Hopes, dreams and reality checks: Part 6 of Tech That Reshaped…</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech\">TechCzech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

And the top of this decade proved no exception. The Verge lists <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019\">84 biggest flops</a> across tech and Audrey Watters came up with <a href=\"http://hackeducation.com/2019/12/31/what-a-shitshow\">100 debacles for ed tech</a> alone. While such schadenfreude may be entertaining or even occasionally edifying, that is not my purpose here.</p><p>I want to take the <a href=\"https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Motte_and_bailey\">motte-and-bailey</a> approach to looking at the hype balloons here. <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4447\">Scott Aaronson did something similar for quantum computing</a> (an area which is so far outside my knowledge that I’m going to skip it entirely). What I want to look at is technologies and transformations that didn’t fail as such. Some of them might even be considered a success. But their success is much more constrained and mundane than it might appear from the hype.</p><p><a href=\"https://metaphorhacker.net/2018/10/innovation-is-bad-for-business-3-more-i-words-to-compare-innovation-to/\">Ignorance of what is possible</a> is an integral part of innovation. So we cannot blame the hype merchants too much. Many of the changes on the list of transformations were also hyped up — and who could have known in 2010 which bubbles would burst which into colourful rainbows of joy and which would produce a dull mist quietly falling to the ground.</p><p>The choice of which items to include in this section are very much subjective and dependent on how we judge the transformative nature of what was achieved against the magnitude of the hype surrounding it. And also how strongly we feel that effect with ourselves and people we know. Many would argue that fitness trackers and smartwatches are much less transformative than I give them credit for and things like smart home and tablets are more so. On a different day, I might make different choices, as well. But while the category may be in dispute, I hope that the underlying reality is much less controversial.</p><h3>Social graph and personalisation</h3><p>For better or worse, social networks have defined the 2010s. The roller coaster of Twitter and Facebook going from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/books/review/how-an-egyptian-revolution-began-on-facebook.html\">saviours of democracy</a> to its <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/22/brittany-kaiser-facebook-is-the-biggest-threat-to-us-democracy.html\">mortal threats</a> may have left many people dizzy. I was always <a href=\"http://metaphorhacker.net/2011/05/the-natural-logistics-of-life-the-internet-really-changes-almost-nothing/\">skeptical of the first</a> and remain <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/effect-of-cambridge-analyticas-facebook-ads-on-the-2016-us-presidential-election-dacb5462155d\">unconvinced by the second</a>. But the fact of the matter remains, that in the 2010s, mass social networks have become inextricably interwoven into the fabric of our society. On balance, their direct impact in most people’s lives was positive — it connected them with those who they otherwise may have lost touch with, but most importantly it made it easier to connect to those who they’re closest to. Places like Reddit allowed people of niche interests to find like minded souls. I could follow this with a litany of bad things that happened to somebody on social media — bullying, doxing, fomo, burn out, etc. — but it’s not clear to me that this would be anything than an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic\">availability bias</a>. Bad things happen.</p><p>But what has definitely failed to live to its promise is the idea that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph\">social graph</a> is going to completely revolutionise everything. I remember listening with incredulity to pundits in the early 2010s that Facebook was threatening Google because of its social graph — people would no longer have to search for anything — like where can I get a plumber — because the social graph would provide the answer. It is true that Twitter and social media <a href=\"https://twobithistory.org/2018/09/16/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss.html\">“killed” RSS</a> — or rather Google did when it discontinued the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2013/03/r-i-p-google-reader/\">much lamented Google Reader</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a>, of course, keeps binding together much of the internet (including podcasts) and <a href=\"https://feedly.com/\">Feedly</a> amply took up the mantle of Google Reader.</p><p>Social graph did not (and never really could) replace search but it took Google probably a billion dollars to find out by the simple expedient of starting and killing a social network in all within about 8 years. Yes, I’m talking about the failure that was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B\">Google Plus</a>. Google Plus <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2015/08/02/google-plus-history/?europe=true\">failed</a> not because it was bad or useless but because Google went into it with the wrong expectations and motivations. Google wanted Facebook’s and Twitter’s data now how people are connected to each other and it thought it could just get it directly from the source. For a while Google Plus was at the heart of everything Google did — even tying <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-just-tied-employee-bonuses-to-the-success-of-the-googles-social-strategy-2011-4\">employee compensations</a> to its performance. Google Plus was a nice alternative to Facebook and Twitter — sitting somewhere between them in terms of what it could be used for. But it didn’t create <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/starwars-movie-star-wars-l2JJKs3I69qfaQleE\">the social graph Google was looking for</a> and now it is dead.</p><p>What the social graph is useful for is targeting advertising and, of course, finding people who share some connection to you. This made <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtargeting\">microtargeting</a> a much easier proposition — but it is not necessary for it. The fear is that combined with other data available about us, a marketing or election campaign can target messages to groups as small as 20 people and convince them more effectively of this or the other. The hope is that we can get all sorts of things personalised just to our own <a href=\"https://www.positivelypresent.com/2009/12/we-are-snowflakes.html\">unique snowflake</a> needs. <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/a-guide-to-personalised-advertising-online/\">Personalised advertising</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine\">personalised medicine</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_learning\">personalised education</a> — the dream of the perfect prediction. But so far, it has been mostly a failure. Ads for things we already bought follow us around the internet like faithful puppies, medicine still works at population level and children are taught in large classes. It is very easy to convince somebody that something was individually tailored to them but in fact personalisation only works if you belong to a big enough group with sufficiently similar interests or needs.</p><p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/\">Google News</a> is a perfect example of this. Many people swear it knows them. But most people’s news interests are very similar. So Google just needs to do a better job of sorting them into the right groups. I only want important political and international news — and local news about events and places — no scandals, no crime, no celebrities, no human interest stories, definitely no sports. I may occasionally be interested in some of those things but I want to seek them out — I don’t want them forced on me. For that reason, I also don’t want any tech news in my general news feed. So I set about training Google News to see if it could learn my personal preferences. It was a failure. Google News shows me local news from places I don’t live anywhere near, it randomly inserts celebrity news. The reason for this is clear — I just don’t generate enough signals to make my preference clear. And that is the case with most personalisation efforts — they work as long as you fit into a big enough bucket.</p><h3>Ereaders and ebooks / E-textbooks and tablets</h3><p>“I read it on my Kindle” is now a phrase that will hardly raise anybody’s eyebrows. And reading on a phone or a tablet are no stranger now than reading a newspaper was 10 years ago. But despite all the promise, ebooks have not made printed books obsolete.</p><p>The Kindle has revolutionised my life. But then I used to travel with 2–3 books anywhere and choosing what to bring with me to read was an agony. Now, all I have to do is pack my Kindle and half my library is available on it and I can add to it anytime I’m within reach of WiFi. On short trips, I may not even bother and just read on my phone. Almost any new book is available as an ebook (although shockingly there are still exceptions) and like audiobooks, ebooks have opened the world of reading to people who could not access print in the old days. I can borrow ebooks from a library (albeit in a limited selection) and if I’m tired of all that, I can access a whole universe of reading with <a href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/\">online fiction</a>, <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/\">fanfiction</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">out-of-copyright works</a>.</p><p>So far so transformative. Why, then, do I have ebooks, e-readers and tablets in the section of overpromise and underdelivery? Well, for one, ebooks have not only not displaced printed books, they have not even <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/19/physical-books-still-outsell-e-books-and-heres-why.html\">overtaken them in sales</a>. Not even close! Ebook sales are not even growing and if anything have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/14/ebook-sales-continue-to-fall-nielsen-survey-uk-book-sales\">fallen in some years</a>. This is mostly due to publishers DRM schemes — no one really buys and ebook — and also horrendous quality control. Ebooks are not helped in the EU by having higher VAT applied to them. New ebooks cost as much as a print book, so why buy something you cannot share, give as a gift, or pass down to your grandchildren? Paperbacks are often cheaper a few years in, used books are easy to find and libraries still offer more print books than ebooks.</p><p>I hate reading print books when it comes to fiction and non-fiction but for non-sequential reading, such as a textbook or a magazine, the ereader or tablet is not as good an experience as their paper counterparts. Which is why, despite their potential, digital textbooks have mostly been a failure. This is partly exemplified by the monumental non-event that was <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/\">Apple’s vaunted iBook Author</a>. What was once expected to be the future of textbook creation never gathered any steam and was completely abandoned by Apple. Almost nobody knows how to actually make an ebook, let alone an e-textbook. Least of all, it sometimes seems, the publishers, who are often content to release a PDF of a textbook as the digital offering. But that cannot be read on a Kindle and even the Tablet reading experience is inferior. Despite their potential, most school <a href=\"https://www.governing.com/columns/tech-talk/gov-tablets-los-angeles-ipad-apple-schools.html\">tablet projects fail</a>.</p><p>The developments in the technology powering reading devices have also stalled. <a href=\"https://goodereader.com/blog/e-paper/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-e-ink-color-e-paper\">Colour e-ink</a> that would refresh fast enough for complex pages is a promise always <a href=\"https://goodereader.com/blog/e-paper/new-print-color-epaper-now-available-for-ereader-and-education-applications\">just a step away</a> and there hasn’t been a step-change in ereader design in years — even the Kindle Oasis was a marginal improvement at best.</p><h3>Smart home and internet of things</h3><p>Smart thermostats, doorbells and lightbulbs are a thing. Smart home is a dream. Many devices exist, but apart from the smart speakers which truly reshaped the world, they play a very small role in people’s lives. The promises of the fully connected and automated home — such that we know from the <a href=\"https://www.the-ambient.com/features/visions-through-the-ages-history-of-home-automation-178\">imaginings of past futurists</a> are still far away. What is more, the reality is that a home will have one thing that is sort of automated. I have smart lights. But only here and there. Nothing works together. And if there is one scenario that is more familiar than the fully connected home is a TV set that only one person really knows how to turn on. Every now and again, we hear a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/18/apple-google-amazon-zigbee-partner-on-smart-home.html\">pronouncement</a> about the <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">one and future interoperability standard</a> that will make the automated blinds work with the connected lights and microwave. But so far, what is more likely to be a reality is a security breach of a connected child monitor or a smart doorbell.</p><p>Yet, this is a category that will likely reshape our world in the future. It just hasn’t done that in the 2010s.</p><h3>Reality will not be televised: The failure of 3D, VR, AR</h3><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)\">Avatar</a> smashed box-office records in 2009 and for the next 5 years, 3D was going to be the Future, 3D movies, <a href=\"https://goodereader.com/blog/technology/curved-4k-3d-tv-is-the-major-trend-at-ces-2014\">3D TVs</a>, 3D Gaming consoles. 3D movies definitely did catch on if only in a limited way but <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/why-3d-tv-died-4126776\">nothing else 3D did</a>. It was just too flaky, hard to use, did not work for everyone and did not improve the experience enough. People are forever <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/3d-tvs-could-be-coming-back-light-field-labs-holographic-3d/\">dreaming</a> about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_display\">holographic displays</a> but despite <a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/the-strange-legacy-of-tupacs-hologram-after-coachella/\">2PAC at Coachella</a>, nothing is just around the corner.</p><p>Next came VR and AR, and there is no doubt that the technology is here and it works. But it is far too niche and limited to have made an impact that could be called transformative. Yes, there are <a href=\"https://www.roadtovr.com/15-vr-games-2020-rift-quest-psvr-index-windows-pc-vive/\">VR games</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pokemongo.com/en-us/\">Pokemon Go</a> showed that AR of sorts is possible. There are credible ways to use VR to teach people and AR glasses like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_HoloLens\">Microsoft HoloLens </a>can be used in medical or engineering training. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/glass/start/\">Google Glass</a> is also a success in certain <a href=\"https://www.electronicdesign.com/industrial-automation/article/21805313/google-glass-is-backin-the-factory\">industries</a>.</p><p>But none of the big transformations once predicted happened. VR in education and gaming is still more of a gimmick and it is not clear how much more it adds to the experience over just plain video. Google’s and Apple’s once-grandiose plans in Augmented Reality have been scaled down greatly. Having said that, there are some clear wins in AR — using the AR when navigating with Google Maps is very handy. Apple’s ability to put people in photos is also great. These technologies are not failures — but their unarguable usefulness is very much limited and constrained. And I don’t expect that to change much in the next 10 years.</p><h3>AI as a category</h3><p>AI seems to be on everyone’s lips. New AI initiatives are springing up left and right, so how could AI have a place in the category of bursting bubbles? Yes, research in the AI field has produced some of the most transformative products of the last decade — speech recognition, image labelling, machine translation, text prediction, computational photography, etc. Those are things that are here to stay and will continue getting better.</p><p>But the attitude of — “we have a problem — let’s slap some AI on it” is just not helpful. For every great advance, there’s a failure. IBM’s Watson which kicked off the decade by beating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/17/ibm-computer-watson-wins-jeopardy\">Jeopardy! champions</a> has been an almost complete failure in medicine, education and business. Chatbots are now very common but are <a href=\"https://blog.aimultiple.com/chatbot-fail/\">almost completely useless</a> and require manual set up. Summarising and synthesizing complex issues is still far out of reach of any automated system. And what’s worse, there’s not much on the horizon that will fix these issues. The great fears of automation of the majority of human jobs are nowhere.</p><p>Self-driving cars, the poster child of what can be done with AI, completely failed to live up to their promise. Most likely, the dreams of <a href=\"https://rodneybrooks.com/my-dated-predictions/\">fully automated driving</a> will probably not even be realised in the next decade.</p><p>Many are now <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/is-another-ai-winter-coming-ac552669e58c\">fearing</a> the second (or third, depending on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/10/20/are-we-heading-for-another-ai-winter-soon/#430a9256d693\">how you count</a>) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter\">AI Winter</a>. That was the result of overpromise and underdelivery in the past. In the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthill_report\">1970s</a> and again in the 1980s, funding for AI research dried up as project after project ended up in failure. I don’t think it will happen now. The AI projects of the past came up with useful algorithmic procedures we’re still using but were pretty much useless as products. Today’s research has resulted in the release of useful products and will continue to do so. Which is why for a company like Google, making ‘machine learning’ the centre of their platform, is a smart bet (as it is for Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Microsoft and others). But the current scramble for ‘let’s make sure we’re using some AI so that we don’t fall behind’ is likely to end with a whimper.</p><h3>Blockchain / bitcoin</h3><p>When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> briefly became <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/a-year-ago-today-bitcoins-price-was-at-a-record-20k\">worth $20,000</a>, the word briefly went crazy. And ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain\">blockchain</a>’ that Bitcoin is built around became the next big thing. Everybody started talking about ‘distributed ledgers’ and the future of unbreakable accountability, self-executing contracts, and the death of centralised databases. Companies started issuing <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-ico/\">ICOs </a>(initial coin offerings) and the future of money was clear — the blockchain. And then, nothing happened. The hullabaloo died down and people researching and innovating with blockchain technologies got on with their work.</p><p>Blockchain is real, it works, it can be made robust and it can be useful. It is a true innovation in how data is managed and shared. But its real applications will be boring, done by companies nobody’s ever heard of or will ever hear of. Yes, it will make its way under the hood of our financial vehicles but it will most likely be in the same way most automotive innovation happens — slowly, invisibly and without much outward notice.</p><h3>Robotics</h3><p>While AI has produced something useful. Robotics has the Roomba and its imitators. There have been advances but the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWSXVS71Js\">Roomba of 2002 and the Roomba of today</a> do not produce markedly different results nor do they look all that different. We are probably over a decade away from useful robot that can truly clean the house and then take out the trash. The current <a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/559952/latest-roomba-vacuum-you-dont-even-have-empty-dust-bin\">self-emptying Roomba</a> just docks and leaves the dust for a human to take out. Robotic hands, robots walking, robots doing almost anything useful is simply much harder to achieve than most people thought. I’d go with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks\">Rodney Brooks</a> — the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks\">father of modern robotics</a> on this.</p><h3>3D printing</h3><p>For a while, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing\">3D printing</a> was all the rage. Going to an <a href=\"https://www.bettshow.com/\">education tradeshow</a> for a few years was like walking into a 3D print lab. And if you are a manufacturer prototyping new products, or a producer of small runs of certain simple widgets like smartphone cases, 3D printing has entirely changed your world. Any engineering student will also have been able to do much more with their trainee designs than ever before.</p><p>But the desktop 3D printers in every home that would save us going to the hardware store to buy a bracket or a sprocket are still not here nor are they on the horizon. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow\">Cory Doctorow’</a>s dream in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers_(novel)\">Makers</a> remains what it was when he put pen to paper, Science Fiction.</p><h3>USB C</h3><p>Oh, the promise of a single standard <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/7\">plug design</a> for all our data and charging needs. And what if that plug was compact, symmetrical and could be inserted without looking. If we went by all the inputs we see on Apple’s devices (other than the iPhone), we’d think that USB C is the present rather than the future. But buying a <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/353410/3-problems-with-usb-c-you-need-to-know/\">USB C cable</a> is still a bit of a lottery, knowing which USB C port will work with my monitor and which with my harddrive is not a trivial thing to know and that’s not even me trying to buy a <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-usb-type-c-hubs\">USB C hub</a> or a <a href=\"https://thunderboltlaptop.com/usb-c-flash-drives/\">USB C memory stick</a>. USB C is here, it works, it is better than the other USB standards. But it has added to rather than replaced the other USB designs. And exploring the warrens of my cables in 2020 is no happier an experience than it was in 2010.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2e88c8ffb928\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/the-hype-bubbles-of-the-2010s-part-5-of-tech-that-reshaped-our-lives-in-the-last-decade-2e88c8ffb928\">The hype bubbles of the 2010s: Part 5 of Tech That Reshaped our Lives in the Last Decade</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech\">TechCzech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

And the top of this decade proved no exception. The Verge lists <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019\">84 biggest flops</a> across tech and Audrey Watters came up with <a href=\"http://hackeducation.com/2019/12/31/what-a-shitshow\">100 debacles for ed tech</a> alone. While such schadenfreude may be entertaining or even occasionally edifying, that is not my purpose here.</p><p>I want to take the <a href=\"https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Motte_and_bailey\">motte-and-bailey</a> approach to looking at the hype balloons here. <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4447\">Scott Aaronson did something similar for quantum computing</a> (an area which is so far outside my knowledge that I’m going to skip it entirely). What I want to look at is technologies and transformations that didn’t fail as such. Some of them might even be considered a success. But their success is much more constrained and mundane than it might appear from the hype.</p><p><a href=\"https://metaphorhacker.net/2018/10/innovation-is-bad-for-business-3-more-i-words-to-compare-innovation-to/\">Ignorance of what is possible</a> is an integral part of innovation. So we cannot blame the hype merchants too much. Many of the changes on the list of transformations were also hyped up — and who could have known in 2010 which bubbles would burst which into colourful rainbows of joy and which would produce a dull mist quietly falling to the ground.</p><p>The choice of which items to include in this section are very much subjective and dependent on how we judge the transformative nature of what was achieved against the magnitude of the hype surrounding it. And also how strongly we feel that effect with ourselves and people we know. Many would argue that fitness trackers and smartwatches are much less transformative than I give them credit for and things like smart home and tablets are more so. On a different day, I might make different choices, as well. But while the category may be in dispute, I hope that the underlying reality is much less controversial.</p><h3>Social graph and personalisation</h3><p>For better or worse, social networks have defined the 2010s. The roller coaster of Twitter and Facebook going from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/books/review/how-an-egyptian-revolution-began-on-facebook.html\">saviours of democracy</a> to its <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/22/brittany-kaiser-facebook-is-the-biggest-threat-to-us-democracy.html\">mortal threats</a> may have left many people dizzy.

Google Plus <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2015/08/02/google-plus-history/?europe=true\">failed</a> not because it was bad or useless but because Google went into it with the wrong expectations and motivations.

The fear is that combined with other data available about us, a marketing or election campaign can target messages to groups as small as 20 people and convince them more effectively of this or the other. The hope is that we can get all sorts of things personalised just to our own <a href=\"https://www.positivelypresent.com/2009/12/we-are-snowflakes.html\">unique snowflake</a> needs. <a href=\"https://econsultancy.com/a-guide-to-personalised-advertising-online/\">Personalised advertising</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine\">personalised medicine</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_learning\">personalised education</a> — the dream of the perfect prediction. But so far, it has been mostly a failure. Ads for things we already bought follow us around the internet like faithful puppies, medicine still works at population level and children are taught in large classes. It is very easy to convince somebody that something was individually tailored to them but in fact personalisation only works if you belong to a big enough group with sufficiently similar interests or needs.</p><p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/\">Google News</a> is a perfect example of this. Many people swear it knows them. But most people’s news interests are very similar. So Google just needs to do a better job of sorting them into the right groups. I only want important political and international news — and local news about events and places — no scandals, no crime, no celebrities, no human interest stories, definitely no sports. I may occasionally be interested in some of those things but I want to seek them out — I don’t want them forced on me. For that reason, I also don’t want any tech news in my general news feed. So I set about training Google News to see if it could learn my personal preferences. It was a failure. Google News shows me local news from places I don’t live anywhere near, it randomly inserts celebrity news. The reason for this is clear — I just don’t generate enough signals to make my preference clear. And that is the case with most personalisation efforts — they work as long as you fit into a big enough bucket.</p><h3>Ereaders and ebooks / E-textbooks and tablets</h3><p>“I read it on my Kindle” is now a phrase that will hardly raise anybody’s eyebrows. And reading on a phone or a tablet are no stranger now than reading a newspaper was 10 years ago. But despite all the promise, ebooks have not made printed books obsolete.</p><p>The Kindle has revolutionised my life. But then I used to travel with 2–3 books anywhere and choosing what to bring with me to read was an agony. Now, all I have to do is pack my Kindle and half my library is available on it and I can add to it anytime I’m within reach of WiFi. On short trips, I may not even bother and just read on my phone. Almost any new book is available as an ebook (although shockingly there are still exceptions) and like audiobooks, ebooks have opened the world of reading to people who could not access print in the old days. I can borrow ebooks from a library (albeit in a limited selection) and if I’m tired of all that, I can access a whole universe of reading with <a href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/\">online fiction</a>, <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/\">fanfiction</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">out-of-copyright works</a>.</p><p>So far so transformative. Why, then, do I have ebooks, e-readers and tablets in the section of overpromise and underdelivery? Well, for one, ebooks have not only not displaced printed books, they have not even <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/19/physical-books-still-outsell-e-books-and-heres-why.html\">overtaken them in sales</a>. Not even close! Ebook sales are not even growing and if anything have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/14/ebook-sales-continue-to-fall-nielsen-survey-uk-book-sales\">fallen in some years</a>. This is mostly due to publishers DRM schemes — no one really buys and ebook — and also horrendous quality control. Ebooks are not helped in the EU by having higher VAT applied to them. New ebooks cost as much as a print book, so why buy something you cannot share, give as a gift, or pass down to your grandchildren? Paperbacks are often cheaper a few years in, used books are easy to find and libraries still offer more print books than ebooks.</p><p>I hate reading print books when it comes to fiction and non-fiction but for non-sequential reading, such as a textbook or a magazine, the ereader or tablet is not as good an experience as their paper counterparts. Which is why, despite their potential, digital textbooks have mostly been a failure. This is partly exemplified by the monumental non-event that was <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/\">Apple’s vaunted iBook Author</a>. What was once expected to be the future of textbook creation never gathered any steam and was completely abandoned by Apple. Almost nobody knows how to actually make an ebook, let alone an e-textbook. Least of all, it sometimes seems, the publishers, who are often content to release a PDF of a textbook as the digital offering. But that cannot be read on a Kindle and even the Tablet reading experience is inferior. Despite their potential, most school <a href=\"https://www.governing.com/columns/tech-talk/gov-tablets-los-angeles-ipad-apple-schools.html\">tablet projects fail</a>.</p><p>The developments in the technology powering reading devices have also stalled. <a href=\"https://goodereader.com/blog/e-paper/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-e-ink-color-e-paper\">Colour e-ink</a> that would refresh fast enough for complex pages is a promise always <a href=\"https://goodereader.com/blog/e-paper/new-print-color-epaper-now-available-for-ereader-and-education-applications\">just a step away</a> and there hasn’t been a step-change in ereader design in years — even the Kindle Oasis was a marginal improvement at best.</p><h3>Smart home and internet of things</h3><p>Smart thermostats, doorbells and lightbulbs are a thing. Smart home is a dream. Many devices exist, but apart from the smart speakers which truly reshaped the world, they play a very small role in people’s lives. The promises of the fully connected and automated home — such that we know from the <a href=\"https://www.the-ambient.com/features/visions-through-the-ages-history-of-home-automation-178\">imaginings of past futurists</a> are still far away. What is more, the reality is that a home will have one thing that is sort of automated. I have smart lights. But only here and there. Nothing works together. And if there is one scenario that is more familiar than the fully connected home is a TV set that only one person really knows how to turn on. Every now and again, we hear a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/18/apple-google-amazon-zigbee-partner-on-smart-home.html\">pronouncement</a> about the <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">one and future interoperability standard</a> that will make the automated blinds work with the connected lights and microwave. But so far, what is more likely to be a reality is a security breach of a connected child monitor or a smart doorbell.</p><p>Yet, this is a category that will likely reshape our world in the future. It just hasn’t done that in the 2010s.</p><h3>Reality will not be televised: The failure of 3D, VR, AR</h3><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)\">Avatar</a> smashed box-office records in 2009 and for the next 5 years, 3D was going to be the Future, 3D movies, <a href=\"https://goodereader.com/blog/technology/curved-4k-3d-tv-is-the-major-trend-at-ces-2014\">3D TVs</a>, 3D Gaming consoles. 3D movies definitely did catch on if only in a limited way but <a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/why-3d-tv-died-4126776\">nothing else 3D did</a>. It was just too flaky, hard to use, did not work for everyone and did not improve the experience enough. People are forever <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/3d-tvs-could-be-coming-back-light-field-labs-holographic-3d/\">dreaming</a> about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_display\">holographic displays</a> but despite <a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/the-strange-legacy-of-tupacs-hologram-after-coachella/\">2PAC at Coachella</a>, nothing is just around the corner.</p><p>Next came VR and AR, and there is no doubt that the technology is here and it works. But it is far too niche and limited to have made an impact that could be called transformative. Yes, there are <a href=\"https://www.roadtovr.com/15-vr-games-2020-rift-quest-psvr-index-windows-pc-vive/\">VR games</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pokemongo.com/en-us/\">Pokemon Go</a> showed that AR of sorts is possible. There are credible ways to use VR to teach people and AR glasses like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_HoloLens\">Microsoft HoloLens </a>can be used in medical or engineering training. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/glass/start/\">Google Glass</a> is also a success in certain <a href=\"https://www.electronicdesign.com/industrial-automation/article/21805313/google-glass-is-backin-the-factory\">industries</a>.</p><p>But none of the big transformations once predicted happened. VR in education and gaming is still more of a gimmick and it is not clear how much more it adds to the experience over just plain video. Google’s and Apple’s once-grandiose plans in Augmented Reality have been scaled down greatly. Having said that, there are some clear wins in AR — using the AR when navigating with Google Maps is very handy. Apple’s ability to put people in photos is also great. These technologies are not failures — but their unarguable usefulness is very much limited and constrained. And I don’t expect that to change much in the next 10 years.</p><h3>AI as a category</h3><p>AI seems to be on everyone’s lips. New AI initiatives are springing up left and right, so how could AI have a place in the category of bursting bubbles? Yes, research in the AI field has produced some of the most transformative products of the last decade — speech recognition, image labelling, machine translation, text prediction, computational photography, etc. Those are things that are here to stay and will continue getting better.</p><p>But the attitude of — “we have a problem — let’s slap some AI on it” is just not helpful. For every great advance, there’s a failure. IBM’s Watson which kicked off the decade by beating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/17/ibm-computer-watson-wins-jeopardy\">Jeopardy! champions</a> has been an almost complete failure in medicine, education and business. Chatbots are now very common but are <a href=\"https://blog.aimultiple.com/chatbot-fail/\">almost completely useless</a> and require manual set up. Summarising and synthesizing complex issues is still far out of reach of any automated system. And what’s worse, there’s not much on the horizon that will fix these issues. The great fears of automation of the majority of human jobs are nowhere.</p><p>Self-driving cars, the poster child of what can be done with AI, completely failed to live up to their promise. Most likely, the dreams of <a href=\"https://rodneybrooks.com/my-dated-predictions/\">fully automated driving</a> will probably not even be realised in the next decade.</p><p>Many are now <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/is-another-ai-winter-coming-ac552669e58c\">fearing</a> the second (or third, depending on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/10/20/are-we-heading-for-another-ai-winter-soon/#430a9256d693\">how you count</a>) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter\">AI Winter</a>. That was the result of overpromise and underdelivery in the past. In the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthill_report\">1970s</a> and again in the 1980s, funding for AI research dried up as project after project ended up in failure. I don’t think it will happen now. The AI projects of the past came up with useful algorithmic procedures we’re still using but were pretty much useless as products. Today’s research has resulted in the release of useful products and will continue to do so. Which is why for a company like Google, making ‘machine learning’ the centre of their platform, is a smart bet (as it is for Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Microsoft and others). But the current scramble for ‘let’s make sure we’re using some AI so that we don’t fall behind’ is likely to end with a whimper.</p><h3>Blockchain / bitcoin</h3><p>When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> briefly became <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/a-year-ago-today-bitcoins-price-was-at-a-record-20k\">worth $20,000</a>, the word briefly went crazy. And ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain\">blockchain</a>’ that Bitcoin is built around became the next big thing. Everybody started talking about ‘distributed ledgers’ and the future of unbreakable accountability, self-executing contracts, and the death of centralised databases. Companies started issuing <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-ico/\">ICOs </a>(initial coin offerings) and the future of money was clear — the blockchain. And then, nothing happened. The hullabaloo died down and people researching and innovating with blockchain technologies got on with their work.</p><p>Blockchain is real, it works, it can be made robust and it can be useful. It is a true innovation in how data is managed and shared. But its real applications will be boring, done by companies nobody’s ever heard of or will ever hear of. Yes, it will make its way under the hood of our financial vehicles but it will most likely be in the same way most automotive innovation happens — slowly, invisibly and without much outward notice.</p><h3>Robotics</h3><p>While AI has produced something useful. Robotics has the Roomba and its imitators. There have been advances but the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWSXVS71Js\">Roomba of 2002 and the Roomba of today</a> do not produce markedly different results nor do they look all that different. We are probably over a decade away from useful robot that can truly clean the house and then take out the trash. The current <a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/559952/latest-roomba-vacuum-you-dont-even-have-empty-dust-bin\">self-emptying Roomba</a> just docks and leaves the dust for a human to take out. Robotic hands, robots walking, robots doing almost anything useful is simply much harder to achieve than most people thought. I’d go with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks\">Rodney Brooks</a> — the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks\">father of modern robotics</a> on this.</p><h3>3D printing</h3><p>For a while, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing\">3D printing</a> was all the rage. Going to an <a href=\"https://www.bettshow.com/\">education tradeshow</a> for a few years was like walking into a 3D print lab. And if you are a manufacturer prototyping new products, or a producer of small runs of certain simple widgets like smartphone cases, 3D printing has entirely changed your world. Any engineering student will also have been able to do much more with their trainee designs than ever before.</p><p>But the desktop 3D printers in every home that would save us going to the hardware store to buy a bracket or a sprocket are still not here nor are they on the horizon. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow\">Cory Doctorow’</a>s dream in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers_(novel)\">Makers</a> remains what it was when he put pen to paper, Science Fiction.</p><h3>USB C</h3><p>Oh, the promise of a single standard <a href=\"http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/7\">plug design</a> for all our data and charging needs. And what if that plug was compact, symmetrical and could be inserted without looking. If we went by all the inputs we see on Apple’s devices (other than the iPhone), we’d think that USB C is the present rather than the future. But buying a <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/353410/3-problems-with-usb-c-you-need-to-know/\">USB C cable</a> is still a bit of a lottery, knowing which USB C port will work with my monitor and which with my harddrive is not a trivial thing to know and that’s not even me trying to buy a <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-usb-type-c-hubs\">USB C hub</a> or a <a href=\"https://thunderboltlaptop.com/usb-c-flash-drives/\">USB C memory stick</a>. USB C is here, it works, it is better than the other USB standards. But it has added to rather than replaced the other USB designs. And exploring the warrens of my cables in 2020 is no happier an experience than it was in 2010.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2e88c8ffb928\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/the-hype-bubbles-of-the-2010s-part-5-of-tech-that-reshaped-our-lives-in-the-last-decade-2e88c8ffb928\">The hype bubbles of the 2010s: Part 5 of Tech That Reshaped our Lives in the Last Decade</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech\">TechCzech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

It even made the words ‘consume content’ make sense because it brought together watching TV, listening to music and reading books into the same category.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wuhhVpVaYMckfa9B\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@pinho?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Pinho .</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>TV and music streaming subscriptions</h3><p>The emergence of Spotify and Netflix as dominant forces in primary sources of music and TV was not exactly a surprise in the 2010s — in fact, it was what many people had been hoping for. But it had a profound impact on how we think about home entertainment.</p><p>First, it changed the notion of ownership — collections of CDs and/or DVDs used to be a significant feature of many homes. Borrowing music or videos from friends and family, giving discs as gifts, those are all things that have disappeared from many people’s lives by 2019. The idea of owning physical media was replaced by paying a subscription and accessing content. To be sure, this is by no means universal — many people have kept their discs and continue to buy more — and vinyl albums have even experienced a revival. But the default expectation has changed. A TV is more likely to be sold now with a built-in streaming option than a built-in DVD.</p><p>One technological consequence of this is that nobody is worried about what will replace the Blu-ray disc in the same way that the successor to the VHS and then the DVD was part of the public discourse. In fact, Blu-ray never even got a chance to <a href=\"https://www.filmstories.co.uk/features/the-growing-number-of-films-that-are-getting-a-release-on-dvd-but-not-blu-ray/\">properly replace DVD</a> which is still the more common disc format for those who buy videos on physical media.</p><p>But the more interesting outcome is the significantly expanded access at a lower price for individual consumers. While people ‘own’ less music and fewer films or TV shows, they can access many more than ever before. Creating a decent CD and/or DVD collection could have cost thousands and would take up space in your home. But more than the cost and space, it would severely limit what you can listen to. Subscribing to Spotify and Netflix costs a fixed monthly fee but you can listen to almost any music ever released and watch hours and hours of TV and film without running out of choices.</p><p>Music and video differ in interesting ways here. Both Spotify and Netflix have many competitors but with Spotify, you only have to choose one or the other. There are some differences in what different music services offer but they are minor and music selection is rarely why people choose one over the other. With video streaming services, however, there is much less overlap. They all have their original programming and exclusive deals with other sources, so it is necessary to subscribe to them all to get the same access as in the days of over-the-air TV or cable TV packages. Also, streaming services did not take over the film and TV market to the same extent that they did the music market.</p><p>One final transformation was to the way music, film and TV were produced. People talk about the death of the album and changes to the way music is mixed to sound better over streaming but overall, the shape of music is still very much the same. Film, other than the usual trends and fashions — like the surge of the superhero movies, has also remained largely the same. TV, on the other hand, has experienced a more substantial transformation that started in 2013 when Netflix decided to release all the episodes of its original series at once. This gave rise to a new phrase and practice ‘binge watching’ but most importantly it allowed creators of TV shows to think much more freely about an overall storyline and episodes became much more like chapters in a book. This is more than a little reminiscent of the rise of the novel which was initially released in serial form until relatively recently.</p><h3>The Rise of YouTube</h3><p>If there is one platform that defined the 2010s and redefined cultural production, it is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube\">YouTube</a>. Started in 2005 and bought by Google in 2006, it went from a popular video sharing site in 2010 to a global centre of cultural production. The 10s saw its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam_Style_(music_video)\">first video reach 1 billion views</a> and the first channel to reach <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PewDiePie\">100 million subscribers</a>. It has made <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/pictures/gjdm45jih/youtube-millionaires/\">millionaires of popular YouTube stars</a> and becoming a ‘YouTuber’ is now as common a dream avocation as movie star once was for many a child.</p><p>The ecosystem that exists around YouTube is also worth noting. Events like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VidCon\">VidCon</a> and sites like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon\">Patreon</a> serve to connect YouTubers with their fans, who can be mobilised into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_challenge\">silly pranks</a> as well as <a href=\"https://teamtrees.org/\">charitable activities</a>. YouTube has branched into original programming but its strength still lies in amateur and semi-professional content. The most common types of content are music, gaming, beauty tips, comedy, vlogging but among the multi-million subscriber behemoths, there is ample space for individuals sharing videos with a few friends.</p><p>YouTube has also shaped the language of video as well as ways of consuming it. Video is now a mobile, personal thing — very much like reading. It is just as common seeing people watching YouTube videos on public transport as it is reading a book. We are much more used to seeing fast-paced, quick-changing videos with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_cut\">‘jump cuts</a>’ and humorous quotations and our expectations of what a video looks like are changing. But YouTube has also truly democratised video production — even though, there are certain styles and production values on the most popular channels are very high, it is still possible to reach an audience with a very basic approach. There are now over 30,000 <a href=\"https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/5000/mostsubscribed\">channels with over a million subscribers</a> and many of these are in languages other than English.</p><p>The place of video in our society is not the only thing that YouTube has changed. It has become a place of an unofficial public record. “Please don’t put that on YouTube” is a phrase (with many variations) that reflects that. Videos appearing on YouTube for good or ill are now an integral part of a story teller’s toolkit and have been part of many a plot of a film or TV show. Historical events (recent and distant), important cultural performances, intellectual discussions, political positions — all are now recorded on YouTube. The site <a href=\"http://openculture.com\">OpenCulture.com</a> records many of these.</p><p>It is not surprising that with millions of YouTube channels receiving hundreds of billions of views, YouTube has had its share of controversies. But the view from the inside is much more interesting. As any large community, YouTube is full of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMwGG285F-M\">internal self-reflection</a>. YouTubers constantly reflect on the state of their platform, its future and their place in it. The early history of YouTube and YouTuberdom was documented in a series of interviews conducted by well-known YouTubers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhett_%26_Link\">Rhett and Link</a> on the first 2 seasons of their podcast <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/earbiscuits\">Ear Biscuits</a>, there they interviews well-known YouTubers of the time — many of whom are no longer active. Two educational YouTubers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGP_Grey\">CGP Grey</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran\">Brady Haran</a> also often talk about YouTube on their podcast <a href=\"http://www.hellointernet.fm/\">Hello Internet</a>. But there are also countless YouTube videos reflecting on the state of YouTube both in serious and humorous ways. It is an exciting space to watch.</p><p>Audrey Watters put YouTube on her list of the <a href=\"http://hackeducation.com/2019/12/31/what-a-shitshow\">100 worst edtech debacles of the 2010s</a> but her examples of negativity come from cliched news reports. I look at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdUhEyZdNhEjEBH_xckkuXF_QxDe8d8Lk\">Marblelympics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/njwildberger/search?query=infinity\">Norman J Wildberger’s math channel</a> or even <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JustKiddingParty\">JK Party</a> and my heart is filled with joy.</p><h3>Online learning and education</h3><p>Speaking of all the things YouTube changed, let’s talk about learning. Far from being just a place for fun and games, YouTube is also a site for learning (which, of course, can be done with fun and games). Many people are now used to going to YouTube first if they want to learn how to do something. There are detailed guides to different camera models, ways of fixing household appliances, recipes, and so much more. I was able to learn two musical instruments (Ukulele and piano) from scratch without once taking a class with a teacher.</p><p>People who want to share knowledge and skills with the world have started doing so on YouTube in large numbers. There’s hardly any software or app that doesn’t have a screencast on YouTube or somebody talking about it. So-called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/unboxtherapy\">‘unboxings’ </a>of new products are a popular category on YouTube but they also have a learning component. It is much easier to buy things online when you’ve seen them ‘in the flesh’ — mediated by another person.</p><p>YouTube has launched a true revolution in online learning. But even people who want help with their formal studies can get a lot of benefit. There are entertaining channels such as Crash Course that will explain aspects of the school curriculum. These are accompanied by a whole class of channels like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA\">Veritasium</a> or <a href=\"https://physicsgirl.org/\">Physics Girl</a> that tackle individual subjects. Perhaps most famous is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Academy\">KhanAcademy</a> which started by Sal Khan making videos for his nephews to help them with High School math and is now a recognised non-profit institution.</p><p>YouTube is also an important repository of academic and cultural legacy of the world. Many important lectures and even university courses (e.g. from MIT) are available. Pick almost any important academic book of the last 20 years and you will find a lecture by the author about it or at least an interview with them about it. The channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUs_uxxQ3l4osUmLgOcF7jXA\">Philosophy Overdose</a> publishes videos of lectures and interviews with famous philosophers — and if you want to learn about what was important to Rorty and Davidson without reading their dense prose, you can now do it. When I wanted to recommend <a href=\"http://metaphorhacker.net/2019/09/so-you-think-you-have-a-historical-analogy-revisionist-history-and-anthropology-reading-list/\">key books in historical revisionism</a> recently, I was able to find videos for all of them.</p><p>Of necessity, the amount of content on YouTube can be a bit overwhelming. The production quality is variable as is the quality of instruction — although often the personal approach of a simple video by someone who has something to explain is more effective than sleekly produced infotainment. But YouTube is not the only place where this revolution in informal learning is taking place — although without it, it is hard to see how it could have been so profound.</p><p>The MOOCs — Massive Open Online Courses — launched into the world in 2011 (although the concept started in 2008) with two Stanford Courses which attracted over 100,000 participants. Almost immediately, the hype started and transformation of Higher Education was predicted to be just around the corner. By 2012 there were three big companies offering MOOCs and MOOC services to universities: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udacity\">Udacity</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera\">Coursera</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdX\">edX</a> later to be joined by FutureLearn and others. As the hype died down and it was clear that no transformation was forthcoming, Udacity stopped offering free MOOCs and switched to paid nano-degrees (an interesting concept in itself). But Coursera, edX and <a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/\">FutureLearn</a> are still going strong and the legacy of the MOOC has become an important feature in the landscape of online learning — even if universities as such still looks very much the same. Anybody who speaks English (or one of the other few languages in which MOOCs are available) can learn from thousands of courses from hundreds of institutions for free. That was certainly not anything anybody expected in 2009.</p><p>But not all this learning is free. The 2010s also saw a huge growth in sites offering paid online courses — almost all video-based or with a video component. Many services like <a href=\"http://digiknow.sbsblogs.co.uk/2019/12/29/alternatives-to-linkedin-learning/\">Lynda (now LinkedIn learning and its comptetitors</a> fill an important niche.</p><h3>Podcasts</h3><p>When MTV kicked off its brief reign as a cultural behemoth with “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Killed_the_Radio_Star\">Video Killed the Radio Star</a>” in 1981, many people predicted the inexorable victory of video entertainment over all other forms. But the 2010s saw the place of radio-type content solidified with the advent of big-time podcasting. Spoken word on the internet had its origins in the 1990s but podcasts did not appear until 2004. They were made possible by two innovations: 1. adding audio attachments to the Real Simple Syndication (RSS) protocol that made it possible for people to subscribe to a podcast feed and receive new updates automatically; 2. The spread of portable audio playback devices — MP3 players — of which the iPod was the most popular. Thus the iPod provided the ‘pod’, RSS the ‘cast’ and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curry\">podcasts</a> were born.</p><p>Podcasts became popular very quickly. Apple added a Podcast section to iTunes in 2005 which has been critical to their rise. And that same year ‘podcast’ was declared the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_the_year\">word of the year</a> in the same year by the OED. Many radio stations started releasing their spoken word programming as podcasts with BBC being one of the first with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl\">In Our Time</a>. But by 2010, it seemed as if podcasts had reached their zenith. The podcast ecosystem was healthy and growing modestly with no fears of decline but it was expected to remain a niche area. This all changed in 2014 when an NPR journalist released <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_(podcast)\">Serial</a> — a true-crime podcast that reached tens of millions of listeners and became part of the national conversation in the US. 10 years after its introduction, the world discovered podcasts.</p><p>Since then, podcasting has grown exponentially. By the end of the 2010s, about half of all Americans have listened to a podcast at some point and about 20% listen at least weekly. Having a podcast is common for <a href=\"https://www.nottoodeep.com/\">YouTubers</a>, <a href=\"https://thebuglepodcast.com/\">comedians</a>, <a href=\"http://podcasts.joerogan.net/\">celebrities</a>, <a href=\"https://consulting.kantar.com/podcasts/\">businesses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/\">academics</a>, <a href=\"https://newbooksnetwork.com/\">educators</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/podcasts\">news organisations</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm\">radio stations</a> and countless individuals. The growth and ubiquity of the smartphone has been a part of this change. In 2009, listening to a podcast on the go was a multistep process and required specialised software and an MP3 player for most people. Finding podcasts was also not straightforward outside the iTunes universe. In 2019, when having a powerful smartphone is the norm, all that is needed is to download one of the many podcast apps, search for something one might be interested in and podcasts just start showing up on your phone for you to listen. Culturally, it has also become much more acceptable to walk around with ear phones in one’s ear (Apple’s white ear buds and lately EarPods leading the way), so there are many more opportunities to listen.</p><p>Podcasting’s future also seems incredibly bright. Many are declaring 2019 to be the <a href=\"https://www.prca.org.uk/2019-PRedictions-The-year-of-the-podcast\">year of the podcast</a>. Two audio behemoths Spotify and Audible have launched into podcasts, NPR purchased a popular podcast player, and advertisers are discovering the power of podcasts for marketing products. Podcasting is part of the culture. “Why don’t you start a podcast” is now a phrase you can use to shut somebody up. There are stereotypes about podcast listeners and podcast hosts. The force of audio is strong.</p><h3>Audiobooks — Reading with your ears</h3><p>Books and stories were being recorded <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiobook\">as soon as it became possible to record audio</a> at any reasonable length. But until recently audiobooks were the domain of people with vision problems and commuters. Their production and distribution were cumbersome, they were much more expensive than printed books and as a consequence only a tiny fraction of published literature was also available in audio. Because of copyright restrictions many audiobooks were only available in libraries for the blind.</p><p>Things started to change in the 2000s with portable audio players that could fit entire books and did away with having to spread them over multiple tapes or CDs. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audible_(store)\">Audible</a> was among the first to release a dedicated digital audiobook player and as its business grew, it started expanding the catalogue of available audiobooks. As with podcasts, audiobooks have come into their own in the 2010s. Now, almost any new book release will come with an audiobook — partly thanks to significant reduction in production costs. There are audiobook narrators who have their own following and famous actors have recorded audiobooks. There are hundreds of thousands of books available in audio and what’s more, they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/26/new-chapter-uk-print-book-sales-fall-while-audiobooks-surge-43\">growing at a much faster pace than ebooks</a>. The audiobook space continued to be dominated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audible_(store)\">Audible</a> (owned by Amazon) but luckily, it is a very vibrant marketplace and — at least from the perspective of consumers — it does not seem to unduly abuse its near monopoly.</p><h3>Games and e-sports</h3><p>Computer games are as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertie_the_Brain\">old as computers</a>. It could be argued that nothing radically new happened with games in the 2010s. There were no radically new game formats — perhaps with the exception of AR and Pokemon Go. Even some of the biggest titles of the decade were just continuations of older franchises: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda\">Legends of Zelda</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War\">Gears of War</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a>, <a href=\"https://supermariobros.io/\">Supermario</a>, etc. — unlike films, games usually get better with each subsequent release. There were also no radical new gaming platforms (although <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch\">Nintendo Switch</a> might come close) even though mobile gaming became a thing.</p><p>But what changed (and continues to change) is the status of games as a narrative genre. Narrative games are also not new — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game\">text adventures</a> are a type of non-linear fiction. Only as people who grew up playing these storyful games age, they start thinking of them in the same way that people who grew up reading books or watching films. Full-blown narratives that are part of the pantheon of the stories that shape our lives. Computer games are an art form — they did not become one in the 2010s — but in the 2010s more and more people who grew up playing games in the 90s and 00s reached middle age and wanted to continue playing. Also, in the 2000s the first generation of serious gamers started having children and in the 2010s, they started thinking about how to best introduce their kids into gaming. And the conversation about games grew much more respectable than before. Children playing computer games is no longer automatically seen as the mindless activity it once was viewed as. And it is not nearly as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKIiUsbOO24\">unusual for adults to play games</a> instead of watching a film or reading a book. And people like me who are not gamers should watch out because <a href=\"https://metaphorhacker.net/2013/04/do-we-need-a-gaming-literacy-literacy-metaphor-hack/\">being able to play games if a sort of literacy</a>.</p><p>However, the one thing that is almost completely new in the 2010s is the pursuit of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Play\">watching other people play games</a>. People playing and commenting on games is one of the biggest video genres on YouTube. The biggest channel run by an individual is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw\">Pewdiepie</a> who gained fame by his funny commentaries on the games he was playing on screen — today, the channel has over 100 million subscribers. And <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PewDiePie\">Pewdiepie</a> started his channel in 2010. In 2011, a new platform appeared called <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\">Twitch</a> that is just for live video streaming of game play (although other things are possible) and <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/\">Discord</a> — a chat platform for people to use while gaming — is becoming a serious social network. In fact, Amazon bought Twitch for almost a billion dollars and now, there are a million people watching video streams on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)\">Twitch</a> at any one time.</p><p>And watching video game play is not just a solitary pursuit. As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports\">e-sports</a> have gathered steam in the 2010s, new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_esports_leagues_and_tournaments\">social occasions</a> are created and even new venues dedicated to e-sports are being built — such as this new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports_Stadium_Arlington\">e-sports stadium</a>. Watching somebody play a game with skillful commentary and editing can be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh-s56XJgfywkHb5XQAJ3fnmPSBqTLmA2\">just as or more entertaining</a> as watching sport or even most other TV.</p><p>Finally, no discussion of games in the 2010s would be complete without <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft\">Minecraft</a> which is ultimate proof (if <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Video_Games_Have_to_Teach_Us_About_Learning_and_Literacy\">proof were needed</a>) that games are a space for people of all ages to be creative and communicative. Its 8-bit retro graphics show that the idea of exploration and communication is more central to gaming than violence or high graphics. When <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/1563546/microsoft-acquires-minecraft-maker-for-2-5-billion/\">Microsoft bought Minecraft</a> for $2.5 billion, it did that at least in part because it saw its potential as a learning space.

It even made the words ‘consume content’ make sense because it brought together watching TV, listening to music and reading books into the same category.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wuhhVpVaYMckfa9B\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@pinho?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Pinho .</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>TV and music streaming subscriptions</h3><p>The emergence of Spotify and Netflix as dominant forces in primary sources of music and TV was not exactly a surprise in the 2010s — in fact, it was what many people had been hoping for. But it had a profound impact on how we think about home entertainment.</p><p>First, it changed the notion of ownership — collections of CDs and/or DVDs used to be a significant feature of many homes. Borrowing music or videos from friends and family, giving discs as gifts, those are all things that have disappeared from many people’s lives by 2019. The idea of owning physical media was replaced by paying a subscription and accessing content. To be sure, this is by no means universal — many people have kept their discs and continue to buy more — and vinyl albums have even experienced a revival. But the default expectation has changed. A TV is more likely to be sold now with a built-in streaming option than a built-in DVD.</p><p>One technological consequence of this is that nobody is worried about what will replace the Blu-ray disc in the same way that the successor to the VHS and then the DVD was part of the public discourse. In fact, Blu-ray never even got a chance to <a href=\"https://www.filmstories.co.uk/features/the-growing-number-of-films-that-are-getting-a-release-on-dvd-but-not-blu-ray/\">properly replace DVD</a> which is still the more common disc format for those who buy videos on physical media.</p><p>But the more interesting outcome is the significantly expanded access at a lower price for individual consumers. While people ‘own’ less music and fewer films or TV shows, they can access many more than ever before. Creating a decent CD and/or DVD collection could have cost thousands and would take up space in your home. But more than the cost and space, it would severely limit what you can listen to. Subscribing to Spotify and Netflix costs a fixed monthly fee but you can listen to almost any music ever released and watch hours and hours of TV and film without running out of choices.</p><p>Music and video differ in interesting ways here. Both Spotify and Netflix have many competitors but with Spotify, you only have to choose one or the other. There are some differences in what different music services offer but they are minor and music selection is rarely why people choose one over the other. With video streaming services, however, there is much less overlap. They all have their original programming and exclusive deals with other sources, so it is necessary to subscribe to them all to get the same access as in the days of over-the-air TV or cable TV packages. Also, streaming services did not take over the film and TV market to the same extent that they did the music market.</p><p>One final transformation was to the way music, film and TV were produced. People talk about the death of the album and changes to the way music is mixed to sound better over streaming but overall, the shape of music is still very much the same. Film, other than the usual trends and fashions — like the surge of the superhero movies, has also remained largely the same. TV, on the other hand, has experienced a more substantial transformation that started in 2013 when Netflix decided to release all the episodes of its original series at once. This gave rise to a new phrase and practice ‘binge watching’ but most importantly it allowed creators of TV shows to think much more freely about an overall storyline and episodes became much more like chapters in a book. This is more than a little reminiscent of the rise of the novel which was initially released in serial form until relatively recently.</p><h3>The Rise of YouTube</h3><p>If there is one platform that defined the 2010s and redefined cultural production, it is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube\">YouTube</a>. Started in 2005 and bought by Google in 2006, it went from a popular video sharing site in 2010 to a global centre of cultural production. The 10s saw its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam_Style_(music_video)\">first video reach 1 billion views</a> and the first channel to reach <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PewDiePie\">100 million subscribers</a>. It has made <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/pictures/gjdm45jih/youtube-millionaires/\">millionaires of popular YouTube stars</a> and becoming a ‘YouTuber’ is now as common a dream avocation as movie star once was for many a child.</p><p>The ecosystem that exists around YouTube is also worth noting. Events like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VidCon\">VidCon</a> and sites like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon\">Patreon</a> serve to connect YouTubers with their fans, who can be mobilised into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_challenge\">silly pranks</a> as well as <a href=\"https://teamtrees.org/\">charitable activities</a>. YouTube has branched into original programming but its strength still lies in amateur and semi-professional content. The most common types of content are music, gaming, beauty tips, comedy, vlogging but among the multi-million subscriber behemoths, there is ample space for individuals sharing videos with a few friends.</p><p>YouTube has also shaped the language of video as well as ways of consuming it. Video is now a mobile, personal thing — very much like reading. It is just as common seeing people watching YouTube videos on public transport as it is reading a book. We are much more used to seeing fast-paced, quick-changing videos with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_cut\">‘jump cuts</a>’ and humorous quotations and our expectations of what a video looks like are changing. But YouTube has also truly democratised video production — even though, there are certain styles and production values on the most popular channels are very high, it is still possible to reach an audience with a very basic approach. There are now over 30,000 <a href=\"https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/5000/mostsubscribed\">channels with over a million subscribers</a> and many of these are in languages other than English.</p><p>The place of video in our society is not the only thing that YouTube has changed. It has become a place of an unofficial public record. “Please don’t put that on YouTube” is a phrase (with many variations) that reflects that. Videos appearing on YouTube for good or ill are now an integral part of a story teller’s toolkit and have been part of many a plot of a film or TV show. Historical events (recent and distant), important cultural performances, intellectual discussions, political positions — all are now recorded on YouTube. The site <a href=\"http://openculture.com\">OpenCulture.com</a> records many of these.</p><p>It is not surprising that with millions of YouTube channels receiving hundreds of billions of views, YouTube has had its share of controversies. But the view from the inside is much more interesting. As any large community, YouTube is full of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMwGG285F-M\">internal self-reflection</a>. YouTubers constantly reflect on the state of their platform, its future and their place in it. The early history of YouTube and YouTuberdom was documented in a series of interviews conducted by well-known YouTubers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhett_%26_Link\">Rhett and Link</a> on the first 2 seasons of their podcast <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/earbiscuits\">Ear Biscuits</a>, there they interviews well-known YouTubers of the time — many of whom are no longer active. Two educational YouTubers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGP_Grey\">CGP Grey</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran\">Brady Haran</a> also often talk about YouTube on their podcast <a href=\"http://www.hellointernet.fm/\">Hello Internet</a>. But there are also countless YouTube videos reflecting on the state of YouTube both in serious and humorous ways. It is an exciting space to watch.</p><p>Audrey Watters put YouTube on her list of the <a href=\"http://hackeducation.com/2019/12/31/what-a-shitshow\">100 worst edtech debacles of the 2010s</a> but her examples of negativity come from cliched news reports.

Far from being just a place for fun and games, YouTube is also a site for learning (which, of course, can be done with fun and games). Many people are now used to going to YouTube first if they want to learn how to do something. There are detailed guides to different camera models, ways of fixing household appliances, recipes, and so much more. I was able to learn two musical instruments (Ukulele and piano) from scratch without once taking a class with a teacher.</p><p>People who want to share knowledge and skills with the world have started doing so on YouTube in large numbers. There’s hardly any software or app that doesn’t have a screencast on YouTube or somebody talking about it. So-called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/unboxtherapy\">‘unboxings’ </a>of new products are a popular category on YouTube but they also have a learning component.

These are accompanied by a whole class of channels like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA\">Veritasium</a> or <a href=\"https://physicsgirl.org/\">Physics Girl</a> that tackle individual subjects. Perhaps most famous is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Academy\">KhanAcademy</a> which started by Sal Khan making videos for his nephews to help them with High School math and is now a recognised non-profit institution.</p><p>YouTube is also an important repository of academic and cultural legacy of the world. Many important lectures and even university courses (e.g. from MIT) are available. Pick almost any important academic book of the last 20 years and you will find a lecture by the author about it or at least an interview with them about it. The channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUs_uxxQ3l4osUmLgOcF7jXA\">Philosophy Overdose</a> publishes videos of lectures and interviews with famous philosophers — and if you want to learn about what was important to Rorty and Davidson without reading their dense prose, you can now do it. When I wanted to recommend <a href=\"http://metaphorhacker.net/2019/09/so-you-think-you-have-a-historical-analogy-revisionist-history-and-anthropology-reading-list/\">key books in historical revisionism</a> recently, I was able to find videos for all of them.</p><p>Of necessity, the amount of content on YouTube can be a bit overwhelming. The production quality is variable as is the quality of instruction — although often the personal approach of a simple video by someone who has something to explain is more effective than sleekly produced infotainment. But YouTube is not the only place where this revolution in informal learning is taking place — although without it, it is hard to see how it could have been so profound.</p><p>The MOOCs — Massive Open Online Courses — launched into the world in 2011 (although the concept started in 2008) with two Stanford Courses which attracted over 100,000 participants. Almost immediately, the hype started and transformation of Higher Education was predicted to be just around the corner. By 2012 there were three big companies offering MOOCs and MOOC services to universities: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udacity\">Udacity</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera\">Coursera</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdX\">edX</a> later to be joined by FutureLearn and others. As the hype died down and it was clear that no transformation was forthcoming, Udacity stopped offering free MOOCs and switched to paid nano-degrees (an interesting concept in itself). But Coursera, edX and <a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/\">FutureLearn</a> are still going strong and the legacy of the MOOC has become an important feature in the landscape of online learning — even if universities as such still looks very much the same. Anybody who speaks English (or one of the other few languages in which MOOCs are available) can learn from thousands of courses from hundreds of institutions for free. That was certainly not anything anybody expected in 2009.</p><p>But not all this learning is free. The 2010s also saw a huge growth in sites offering paid online courses — almost all video-based or with a video component. Many services like <a href=\"http://digiknow.sbsblogs.co.uk/2019/12/29/alternatives-to-linkedin-learning/\">Lynda (now LinkedIn learning and its comptetitors</a> fill an important niche.</p><h3>Podcasts</h3><p>When MTV kicked off its brief reign as a cultural behemoth with “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Killed_the_Radio_Star\">Video Killed the Radio Star</a>” in 1981, many people predicted the inexorable victory of video entertainment over all other forms. But the 2010s saw the place of radio-type content solidified with the advent of big-time podcasting. Spoken word on the internet had its origins in the 1990s but podcasts did not appear until 2004. They were made possible by two innovations: 1. adding audio attachments to the Real Simple Syndication (RSS) protocol that made it possible for people to subscribe to a podcast feed and receive new updates automatically; 2. The spread of portable audio playback devices — MP3 players — of which the iPod was the most popular. Thus the iPod provided the ‘pod’, RSS the ‘cast’ and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Curry\">podcasts</a> were born.</p><p>Podcasts became popular very quickly. Apple added a Podcast section to iTunes in 2005 which has been critical to their rise. And that same year ‘podcast’ was declared the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_the_year\">word of the year</a> in the same year by the OED. Many radio stations started releasing their spoken word programming as podcasts with BBC being one of the first with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl\">In Our Time</a>. But by 2010, it seemed as if podcasts had reached their zenith. The podcast ecosystem was healthy and growing modestly with no fears of decline but it was expected to remain a niche area. This all changed in 2014 when an NPR journalist released <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_(podcast)\">Serial</a> — a true-crime podcast that reached tens of millions of listeners and became part of the national conversation in the US. 10 years after its introduction, the world discovered podcasts.</p><p>Since then, podcasting has grown exponentially. By the end of the 2010s, about half of all Americans have listened to a podcast at some point and about 20% listen at least weekly. Having a podcast is common for <a href=\"https://www.nottoodeep.com/\">YouTubers</a>, <a href=\"https://thebuglepodcast.com/\">comedians</a>, <a href=\"http://podcasts.joerogan.net/\">celebrities</a>, <a href=\"https://consulting.kantar.com/podcasts/\">businesses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/\">academics</a>, <a href=\"https://newbooksnetwork.com/\">educators</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/podcasts\">news organisations</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm\">radio stations</a> and countless individuals. The growth and ubiquity of the smartphone has been a part of this change. In 2009, listening to a podcast on the go was a multistep process and required specialised software and an MP3 player for most people. Finding podcasts was also not straightforward outside the iTunes universe. In 2019, when having a powerful smartphone is the norm, all that is needed is to download one of the many podcast apps, search for something one might be interested in and podcasts just start showing up on your phone for you to listen. Culturally, it has also become much more acceptable to walk around with ear phones in one’s ear (Apple’s white ear buds and lately EarPods leading the way), so there are many more opportunities to listen.</p><p>Podcasting’s future also seems incredibly bright. Many are declaring 2019 to be the <a href=\"https://www.prca.org.uk/2019-PRedictions-The-year-of-the-podcast\">year of the podcast</a>. Two audio behemoths Spotify and Audible have launched into podcasts, NPR purchased a popular podcast player, and advertisers are discovering the power of podcasts for marketing products. Podcasting is part of the culture. “Why don’t you start a podcast” is now a phrase you can use to shut somebody up. There are stereotypes about podcast listeners and podcast hosts. The force of audio is strong.</p><h3>Audiobooks — Reading with your ears</h3><p>Books and stories were being recorded <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiobook\">as soon as it became possible to record audio</a> at any reasonable length. But until recently audiobooks were the domain of people with vision problems and commuters. Their production and distribution were cumbersome, they were much more expensive than printed books and as a consequence only a tiny fraction of published literature was also available in audio. Because of copyright restrictions many audiobooks were only available in libraries for the blind.</p><p>Things started to change in the 2000s with portable audio players that could fit entire books and did away with having to spread them over multiple tapes or CDs. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audible_(store)\">Audible</a> was among the first to release a dedicated digital audiobook player and as its business grew, it started expanding the catalogue of available audiobooks. As with podcasts, audiobooks have come into their own in the 2010s. Now, almost any new book release will come with an audiobook — partly thanks to significant reduction in production costs. There are audiobook narrators who have their own following and famous actors have recorded audiobooks. There are hundreds of thousands of books available in audio and what’s more, they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/26/new-chapter-uk-print-book-sales-fall-while-audiobooks-surge-43\">growing at a much faster pace than ebooks</a>. The audiobook space continued to be dominated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audible_(store)\">Audible</a> (owned by Amazon) but luckily, it is a very vibrant marketplace and — at least from the perspective of consumers — it does not seem to unduly abuse its near monopoly.</p><h3>Games and e-sports</h3><p>Computer games are as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertie_the_Brain\">old as computers</a>. It could be argued that nothing radically new happened with games in the 2010s. There were no radically new game formats — perhaps with the exception of AR and Pokemon Go. Even some of the biggest titles of the decade were just continuations of older franchises: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda\">Legends of Zelda</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War\">Gears of War</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a>, <a href=\"https://supermariobros.io/\">Supermario</a>, etc. — unlike films, games usually get better with each subsequent release. There were also no radical new gaming platforms (although <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch\">Nintendo Switch</a> might come close) even though mobile gaming became a thing.</p><p>But what changed (and continues to change) is the status of games as a narrative genre. Narrative games are also not new — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game\">text adventures</a> are a type of non-linear fiction. Only as people who grew up playing these storyful games age, they start thinking of them in the same way that people who grew up reading books or watching films. Full-blown narratives that are part of the pantheon of the stories that shape our lives. Computer games are an art form — they did not become one in the 2010s — but in the 2010s more and more people who grew up playing games in the 90s and 00s reached middle age and wanted to continue playing. Also, in the 2000s the first generation of serious gamers started having children and in the 2010s, they started thinking about how to best introduce their kids into gaming. And the conversation about games grew much more respectable than before. Children playing computer games is no longer automatically seen as the mindless activity it once was viewed as. And it is not nearly as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKIiUsbOO24\">unusual for adults to play games</a> instead of watching a film or reading a book. And people like me who are not gamers should watch out because <a href=\"https://metaphorhacker.net/2013/04/do-we-need-a-gaming-literacy-literacy-metaphor-hack/\">being able to play games if a sort of literacy</a>.</p><p>However, the one thing that is almost completely new in the 2010s is the pursuit of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Play\">watching other people play games</a>. People playing and commenting on games is one of the biggest video genres on YouTube. The biggest channel run by an individual is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw\">Pewdiepie</a> who gained fame by his funny commentaries on the games he was playing on screen — today, the channel has over 100 million subscribers. And <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PewDiePie\">Pewdiepie</a> started his channel in 2010. In 2011, a new platform appeared called <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\">Twitch</a> that is just for live video streaming of game play (although other things are possible) and <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/\">Discord</a> — a chat platform for people to use while gaming — is becoming a serious social network. In fact, Amazon bought Twitch for almost a billion dollars and now, there are a million people watching video streams on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)\">Twitch</a> at any one time.</p><p>And watching video game play is not just a solitary pursuit. As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports\">e-sports</a> have gathered steam in the 2010s, new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_esports_leagues_and_tournaments\">social occasions</a> are created and even new venues dedicated to e-sports are being built — such as this new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports_Stadium_Arlington\">e-sports stadium</a>. Watching somebody play a game with skillful commentary and editing can be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh-s56XJgfywkHb5XQAJ3fnmPSBqTLmA2\">just as or more entertaining</a> as watching sport or even most other TV.</p><p>Finally, no discussion of games in the 2010s would be complete without <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft\">Minecraft</a> which is ultimate proof (if <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Video_Games_Have_to_Teach_Us_About_Learning_and_Literacy\">proof were needed</a>) that games are a space for people of all ages to be creative and communicative. Its 8-bit retro graphics show that the idea of exploration and communication is more central to gaming than violence or high graphics. When <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/1563546/microsoft-acquires-minecraft-maker-for-2-5-billion/\">Microsoft bought Minecraft</a> for $2.5 billion, it did that at least in part because it saw its potential as a learning space. As always, that claim was a bit overblown but Minecraft did have interesting educational applications from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/5js5je/turing_machine_in_minecraft/\">the very start</a>.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=81a170a3bfd3\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/media-and-content-consumption-trends-of-the-2010s-part-4-of-tech-that-reshaped-our-lives-in-the-81a170a3bfd3\">Media and content consumption trends of the 2010s: Part 4 of Tech That Reshaped our Lives in the…</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech\">TechCzech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

I always carried a few with me, usually around my neck. The USB drive replaced the previously ubiquitous floppy disk which was the data-transfer medium of the 1990s (even if they lost their floppiness). And while USB sticks are still extremely common and useful, they have been replaced in my life by cloud storage.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Dropbox\">Dropbox launched in 2008</a> and I set up my free account in 2009. By 2012, Dropbox had 100 million users, and the worry about whether all my machines had the same version of my files slowly faded away. As did worrying too much about losing the only copy of my file with my USB stick. Over the last 10 years, the idea of having only one version of my file on one machine has become more and more preposterous. And that’s not even taking into account the powerful collaboration features which have made Dropbox so common in academic projects.</p><p>Many of Dropbox’s smaller competitors like <a href=\"https://spideroak.com/\">SpiderOak</a> or <a href=\"https://www.syncplicity.com/en\">Syncplicity</a> (both of which I also used) have moved away from serving consumers but the 2 big juggernauts in this space are <a href=\"https://www.google.com/drive/\">Google Drive</a> and <a href=\"https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-US/\">Microsoft OneDrive</a> which more than take up the slack. I still use all three of these for different purposes and different projects but there’s not a single document I create that is not in one of these.</p><h3>Google Photos</h3><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos\">Google Photos</a>, launched in 2015, completely changed what a person could do with their photo collection. People who cared about their photos always had services like Flickr or SmugMug but that was too much work for most.</p><p>Google Photos took away 2 great chores with photos: 1. Backing them up and 2. Organising them in albums.</p><p>Since by 2015, most photos were taken by mobile phones, many people had to worry about what happens to their photos when they change (or lose phones). That worry completely disappeared with Google Photos. You can now access photos from any phone or computer if you have Google Photos do an automatic sync. In 2015, I capsized my canoe and drowned my phone which I was using to take pictures earlier. By the time I got home, all my pictures until the phone took its dip were backed up.</p><p>But, sync and backup is only a marginal benefit. Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/icloud/\">iCloud</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a> or Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-US/\">OneDrive </a>now do the same thing. The real revolution is the power of search and automatic organisation of my photos. I can see all the pictures I took of birds just by searching for ‘bird’. It automatically creates albums and collages for me. But the most transformative is the ‘On this day’ feature which periodically reminds me what I was doing at some point in the past. Now that I have connected my <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/smart-display\">Lenovo Smart Displays</a>, I also see these reminders as I sit in my chair and write these words.</p><p>Since it is our past that shapes us, how much more personally transformative can a technology get than this. Sure, we have had albums for as long there have been photos but looking at them was a deliberate act which was rare and took extra effort. Some might see that as a virtue, but most people say that they wish they would look at their photos more often, now they can. And thanks to the sharing and family features, it can not only bring them closer to happy moments of their own past but also closer to each other.</p><h3>Cost of software and subscription pricing</h3><p>As 2010 hove into view on the calendar, the rise of the app was in full swing, although the App Store only had a little over <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/11/04Apple-Announces-Over-100-000-Apps-Now-Available-on-the-App-Store/\">100,000 apps</a>. But as the numbers grew, not only did people start talking about the ‘app economy’ but also perceptions about how much software should cost were changing. Most apps cost between 1 and 5 dollars, and with tens of millions of potential buyers, this seemed like a great way to get rich quick. But as a business model, it soon proved unsustainable because people were also expecting to get free upgrades for the same price. And since many apps also included some sort of online service component, it was impossible to fund this only by getting new users to pay for the app.</p><p>Several business models emerged. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction\">In-app purchases</a> became especially popular with “free-to-play” games as did things like ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box\">loot boxes</a>’. But by far the most fundamental shift is the number of apps that charge a monthly or yearly subscription. This has the advantage of steady and predictable income for developers and guarantee of frequent updates for the customers. Of course, it is very much a double-edged sword for light users. Particularly since the big players caught wind of this trend. The biggest were Adobe and Microsoft which started offering their core software as part of a monthly subscription. First optionally and later as the only way (for Adobe).</p><p>Not all apps or software packages are available as a subscription but it is very much becoming the norm. How sustainable this will be in the long-run is an open question. There are only so many ‘affordable’ monthly payments one can commit to before it all becomes unaffordable but there still seems to be room for growth.</p><p>While people talk about Photoshop, I saw this with my favourite freemium mind mapping tool <a href=\"https://www.xmind.net/\">XMind</a>. It introduced a subscription for the latest version which would be find if it was accompanied by monthly release of new features. But it wasn’t. Luckily, I still have the latest full version (which they continue to offer) which I own — I have paid for several upgrades in the past but the subscription feels like a trap. If I can’t afford to pay any more or my usage becomes lighter, I lose access to the software for ever.</p><h3>Google Docs, autosave and live collaboration</h3><p>“Save your work” used to be a mantra of all IT teachers and friendly neighbourhood IT helpers. Who hasn’t come across an unfortunate soul who lost hours of work simply because the computer crashed and they ‘forgot to save their document’. It may still happen but thanks to the change introduced by Google Docs and now also in Word, it is much rarer. Because now, your document is saved not just every few minutes (if you remembered to set up autosave) but it is saved as you type letter by letter.</p><p>That change came along with the feature of live collaboration where not only can people edit the same document wiki-style, they can also collaborate on it live. I’ve been part of a session where 70 people were editing the same document. And these features have slowly migrated to Microsoft’s office suite with Office 365.</p><p>I wrote this entire document in Google Docs over 4 different machines: my laptop, my Chromebox, my desktop and combined with some light proofreading on my phone. At no point was I worried about making sure that all my versions are synchronised. And I could publish the draft for anyone to see and, if they so desired, to comment on it.</p><p>This change has not completely (much to my chagrin) eliminated email attachments — some habits die hard — but we are now on the way towards that happy day when the first instinct of somebody wanting me to comment on a document will be to share it rather than email it.</p><h3>ChromeOS and software as a service (SaaS)</h3><p>Speaking of Google Docs, let’s not forget about another change that has reshaped our lives. How do you install Google Docs? You don’t! It lives “in the cloud”. It is a service provided by Google — for free no less. Software as a service (or SaaS) was not invented in the 2010s. In fact, “<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-network-is-the-computer/\">the network is the computer</a>” was the aspirational slogan of the now-departed Sun Microsystems in the 1980s and 1990s. Back then, networks were slow and unreliable and we couldn’t get away from them fast enough with the personal computer revolution. The more computing I could do on my own PC, the safer I would feel.</p><p>Well, not any more. Global networks are now fast and reliable enough that software that does not have to be installed and can run in the browser is now the default consideration for any new corporate purchase. Even home users often do away with an email client or even a word processor in favour of web-based services. Google has even introduced ChromeOS an entire operating system where the browser is the way all applications are accessed. When ChromeOS and Chromebooks were first released in 2011, everybody was scratching their heads. I can have a browser on any computer. Why would I want to buy a computer that only has the browser and nothing else? But Google was proved right and now Chromebooks dominate US schools who love computers that are always automatically up to date and can be used by any user who always sees all their files when they login.</p><p>We are still not (and may not be for a while) in a situation where anywhere we are, we can access a high-speed, low-latency connection, so ChromeOS has slowly added features that enable offline work and it is now even possible to install Android Apps locally. But Chromebooks still ship with very small hard drives and almost all the files a user will access are cloud-based.</p><p>ChromeOS has taken the SaaS idea to an extreme but it is clear that our expectations of what a software is and how to get it have been transformed over the course of the 2010s.</p><h3>Automatic software updates</h3><p>Speaking of crazy things Google did under the heading of Chrome… In 2008, when it released the Chrome browser, it came with a feature that was unheard of — automatic updates. Chrome would not require you to go and search for the latest version, it would update automatically without even letting the users know. One day you would launch Chrome and the latest version would be available. The idea had obvious appeal. Imagine not having to worry about which version of the browser a user has. They always have the latest one. Imagine always having the latest, most secure version of your software.</p><p>But it also seemed crazy. All software has bugs and upgrading software versions was a process fraught with dangers. What are the chances of the world one day waking up to all its browsers having been broken by a faulty update? In 2008, they seemed very high. But Google managed to pull it off despite <a href=\"https://www.webnots.com/how-to-fix-google-chrome-update-problems/\">a few hiccups</a>, auto-updating software is now the default on mobile platforms and becoming commonplace on desktop computers. From the operating system to the office applications. For some, Microsoft has taken this to the extreme with regular updates to Office 365 but adding useful features one by one over time is probably better than releasing a big version every 2–3 years.</p><h3>Open Source and Open Data</h3><p>Another change that has roots much earlier than 2010 is the rise of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software\">Open Source software</a>. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation\">Free Software Foundation</a> was founded in 1985 and its poster-child <a href=\"https://www.linux.org/\">Linux</a> was first released in 1991. The 2000s saw a huge growth of Open Source software and associated business models. When <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/141409/article.html\">Sun acquired</a> the Open Source database company <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL\">MySQL</a> in 2008 for $1 billion, it was clear that Open Source was a force to be reckoned with. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\">Wordpress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/\">Drupal </a>and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joomla\">Joomla </a>dominated and continue to dominate the website content management system (CMS) market despite being entirely Open Source. Linux powers the majority of servers on the internet.</p><p>What the 2010s brought was the normalisation of the idea that Open Source is the way to go. More and more companies release their software under Open Source licenses and more and more institutions are comfortable using Open Source products. Even Microsoft, whose former CEO <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/\">Steve Balmer once called Linux “a cancer”</a> is now releasing <a href=\"https://opensource.microsoft.com/\">Open Source tools</a>. What the 2010s have shown is that Open and Closed source systems can co-exist and benefit from each others’ strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Many of the applications on this list are Open Source or rely on Open Source components and infrastructure. Chrome, ChromeOS, Android are built on Open Source software. Google Docs, Google Photos or even Facebook rely on infrastructure that is powered by Open Source and what’s more important, they contribute back to it. <a href=\"https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/wiki\">Two </a>of the <a href=\"https://moodle.org/\">four</a> main LMS/VLE systems are also open source as is one system that powers a <a href=\"https://open.edx.org/\">major MOOC provider</a>..</p><p>The one area where Open Source completely dominates is the so-called “Artificial Intelligence”. Almost all the key software used for working in the AI field is open source. All the major companies leading the AI field, Google, Microsoft and to a lesser degree Apple and Amazon, either release Open Source versions of their tools, models and even many data sets. And all the main breakthroughs in the field have been published as open academic papers. It is very much openness that drives AI and machine learning forward. If someone tries to sell you a super-secret proprietary machine learning system, it’s almost certainly snake oil.</p><h3>Speech recognition and image classification with neural networks</h3><p>In the previous section, I introduced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\">AI</a> as “so-called” because it’s really a grab bag of quite distinct approaches to processing large amounts of data. AI is not some general-purpose procedure that can be applied to problems, it is an approach/philosophy, a collection of possible tools and heuristics relying on similar assumptions about statistical properties of data. All this is by way of explaining why I don’t have AI as the trend but rather some specific applications of it.</p><p>By the early 2010s advances in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition\">speech recognition (ASR)</a> have virtually plateaued and the idea of recognising objects in an image was just a pipe dream. The MIT were even considering dropping <a href=\"https://deeplearning.mit.edu/\">neural nets from their intro to AI course</a>. But all that changed in 2012 with <a href=\"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf\">the release of a paper</a> that showed that using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit\">GPUs</a> to reimplement <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network\">convolutional neural networks</a> first proposed in the 1980s (based on ideas going back to 1950s) could lead to remarkable results when it comes to labelling images.

Not only can you now give short commands to your Amazon Echo or Google Home, you can dictate your documents via <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/4492226?hl=en\">voice typing to Google Docs</a> in 70 languages. If you tried <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en\">automatic captions on YouTube</a> videos in 2015, the results would have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MuDgfX9C2w\">comical</a>. Today, they get almost everything right.</p><p>It is important to remember that neither speech recognition nor image labeling are fully solved problems.

Messaging platforms were nothing new in 2009 when Whatsapp was released. Texting had already become commonplace and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging\">Instant Messaging</a> had its roots in the 1980s and got a huge boost with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ\">ICQ</a> and all its competitors in the mid-1990s. But when combined with mobile phones, ubiquitous data, group chatting features and photo sharing, their utility went through the roof.</p><p>Perhaps the poster child for the success of instant messaging is is WeChat which holds sway in China and allows for much more than just chatting. Although all the messaging platforms are global, they do have regional preferences. In some countries, people seem to prefer Viber or Facebook Messenger over Whatsapp. We should also not forget the rise of Snapchat and Instagram as a chat platform for many young people.</p><p>These platforms have changed people’s expectations about how to connect with each other, where to go online to discuss things and what to use their phones for.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3b824a6bb6e1\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/software-trends-of-the-2010s-part-3-of-tech-that-reshaped-our-lives-in-the-last-decade-3b824a6bb6e1\">Software Trends of the 2010s: Part 3 of Tech That Reshaped our Lives in the Last Decade</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech\">TechCzech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

I always carried a few with me, usually around my neck. The USB drive replaced the previously ubiquitous floppy disk which was the data-transfer medium of the 1990s (even if they lost their floppiness). And while USB sticks are still extremely common and useful, they have been replaced in my life by cloud storage.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Dropbox\">Dropbox launched in 2008</a> and I set up my free account in 2009. By 2012, Dropbox had 100 million users, and the worry about whether all my machines had the same version of my files slowly faded away. As did worrying too much about losing the only copy of my file with my USB stick. Over the last 10 years, the idea of having only one version of my file on one machine has become more and more preposterous. And that’s not even taking into account the powerful collaboration features which have made Dropbox so common in academic projects.</p><p>Many of Dropbox’s smaller competitors like <a href=\"https://spideroak.com/\">SpiderOak</a> or <a href=\"https://www.syncplicity.com/en\">Syncplicity</a> (both of which I also used) have moved away from serving consumers but the 2 big juggernauts in this space are <a href=\"https://www.google.com/drive/\">Google Drive</a> and <a href=\"https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-US/\">Microsoft OneDrive</a> which more than take up the slack. I still use all three of these for different purposes and different projects but there’s not a single document I create that is not in one of these.</p><h3>Google Photos</h3><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos\">Google Photos</a>, launched in 2015, completely changed what a person could do with their photo collection. People who cared about their photos always had services like Flickr or SmugMug but that was too much work for most.</p><p>Google Photos took away 2 great chores with photos: 1. Backing them up and 2. Organising them in albums.</p><p>Since by 2015, most photos were taken by mobile phones, many people had to worry about what happens to their photos when they change (or lose phones). That worry completely disappeared with Google Photos. You can now access photos from any phone or computer if you have Google Photos do an automatic sync. In 2015, I capsized my canoe and drowned my phone which I was using to take pictures earlier. By the time I got home, all my pictures until the phone took its dip were backed up.</p><p>But, sync and backup is only a marginal benefit. Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/icloud/\">iCloud</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a> or Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-US/\">OneDrive </a>now do the same thing. The real revolution is the power of search and automatic organisation of my photos. I can see all the pictures I took of birds just by searching for ‘bird’. It automatically creates albums and collages for me. But the most transformative is the ‘On this day’ feature which periodically reminds me what I was doing at some point in the past. Now that I have connected my <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/smart-display\">Lenovo Smart Displays</a>, I also see these reminders as I sit in my chair and write these words.</p><p>Since it is our past that shapes us, how much more personally transformative can a technology get than this. Sure, we have had albums for as long there have been photos but looking at them was a deliberate act which was rare and took extra effort. Some might see that as a virtue, but most people say that they wish they would look at their photos more often, now they can. And thanks to the sharing and family features, it can not only bring them closer to happy moments of their own past but also closer to each other.</p><h3>Cost of software and subscription pricing</h3><p>As 2010 hove into view on the calendar, the rise of the app was in full swing, although the App Store only had a little over <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/11/04Apple-Announces-Over-100-000-Apps-Now-Available-on-the-App-Store/\">100,000 apps</a>. But as the numbers grew, not only did people start talking about the ‘app economy’ but also perceptions about how much software should cost were changing. Most apps cost between 1 and 5 dollars, and with tens of millions of potential buyers, this seemed like a great way to get rich quick. But as a business model, it soon proved unsustainable because people were also expecting to get free upgrades for the same price. And since many apps also included some sort of online service component, it was impossible to fund this only by getting new users to pay for the app.</p><p>Several business models emerged. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction\">In-app purchases</a> became especially popular with “free-to-play” games as did things like ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box\">loot boxes</a>’. But by far the most fundamental shift is the number of apps that charge a monthly or yearly subscription. This has the advantage of steady and predictable income for developers and guarantee of frequent updates for the customers. Of course, it is very much a double-edged sword for light users. Particularly since the big players caught wind of this trend. The biggest were Adobe and Microsoft which started offering their core software as part of a monthly subscription. First optionally and later as the only way (for Adobe).</p><p>Not all apps or software packages are available as a subscription but it is very much becoming the norm. How sustainable this will be in the long-run is an open question. There are only so many ‘affordable’ monthly payments one can commit to before it all becomes unaffordable but there still seems to be room for growth.</p><p>While people talk about Photoshop, I saw this with my favourite freemium mind mapping tool <a href=\"https://www.xmind.net/\">XMind</a>. It introduced a subscription for the latest version which would be find if it was accompanied by monthly release of new features. But it wasn’t. Luckily, I still have the latest full version (which they continue to offer) which I own — I have paid for several upgrades in the past but the subscription feels like a trap. If I can’t afford to pay any more or my usage becomes lighter, I lose access to the software for ever.</p><h3>Google Docs, autosave and live collaboration</h3><p>“Save your work” used to be a mantra of all IT teachers and friendly neighbourhood IT helpers. Who hasn’t come across an unfortunate soul who lost hours of work simply because the computer crashed and they ‘forgot to save their document’. It may still happen but thanks to the change introduced by Google Docs and now also in Word, it is much rarer. Because now, your document is saved not just every few minutes (if you remembered to set up autosave) but it is saved as you type letter by letter.</p><p>That change came along with the feature of live collaboration where not only can people edit the same document wiki-style, they can also collaborate on it live. I’ve been part of a session where 70 people were editing the same document. And these features have slowly migrated to Microsoft’s office suite with Office 365.</p><p>I wrote this entire document in Google Docs over 4 different machines: my laptop, my Chromebox, my desktop and combined with some light proofreading on my phone. At no point was I worried about making sure that all my versions are synchronised. And I could publish the draft for anyone to see and, if they so desired, to comment on it.</p><p>This change has not completely (much to my chagrin) eliminated email attachments — some habits die hard — but we are now on the way towards that happy day when the first instinct of somebody wanting me to comment on a document will be to share it rather than email it.</p><h3>ChromeOS and software as a service (SaaS)</h3><p>Speaking of Google Docs, let’s not forget about another change that has reshaped our lives. How do you install Google Docs? You don’t! It lives “in the cloud”. It is a service provided by Google — for free no less. Software as a service (or SaaS) was not invented in the 2010s. In fact, “<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-network-is-the-computer/\">the network is the computer</a>” was the aspirational slogan of the now-departed Sun Microsystems in the 1980s and 1990s.

In some countries, people seem to prefer Viber or Facebook Messenger over Whatsapp. We should also not forget the rise of Snapchat and Instagram as a chat platform for many young people.</p><p>These platforms have changed people’s expectations about how to connect with each other, where to go online to discuss things and what to use their phones for.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3b824a6bb6e1\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech/software-trends-of-the-2010s-part-3-of-tech-that-reshaped-our-lives-in-the-last-decade-3b824a6bb6e1\">Software Trends of the 2010s: Part 3 of Tech That Reshaped our Lives in the Last Decade</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/techczech\">TechCzech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

People even felt the need to invent a new term for this, a ‘phablet’. When I saw friend hold her Note to her ear, it looked so strange I had to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Lq3SqpxKpQ/\">take a picture</a>. When I look at it now, it looks perfectly normal.</p><p>In fact, it could be hard to find a phone with a screen that small. Even the smallest iPhone of the latest generation has a screen of 6.1 inches. This changed not only what we can do on our phones: read books, watch films, write, etc. It also changed what we expect phones to look like. What a transformation from 2010 today.</p><h3>Midrange phones</h3><p>When I bought my first smartphone, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Desire\">HTC Desire</a> in 2010, it was the top of the line Android phone available, at that time. A few years later, I upgraded to the Galaxy Note 2 which was also a flagship product. But ever since I bought the <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_one-6327.php\">OnePlus One</a> in 2015, I never felt the need to go for the top of the line. This is partly because flagship smartphone prices have trended up in the last 5 years but even more so, because the mid-range phones have become good enough for any normal need.</p><p>Today, I’ve had the <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_5t-8912.php\">OnePlus 5T</a> for over 2 years and see no reason to upgrade. But if somebody asked me which phone to get today, I would say (and have said), that any Android point in the £200 range will be more than enough for them. <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_g-5831.php\">Moto G</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_note_8-9814.php\">Xiaomi Note 8</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a50-9554.php\">Samsung Galaxy A50</a> — any of these will be more than enough. In fact, I helped a friend buy the Galaxy A50 earlier this year and she could not be happier.</p><h3>Phone cameras / Computational photography</h3><p>If the 2010s were a decade of anything, they were the decade of the smartphone camera. Mobile phones with cameras were certainly available before but it was the iPhone with its large screen and pinch to zoom that made the idea of taking pictures on the phone seem like something really useful. That seed planted in the late 00s blossomed into a beautiful flower. Very few people think about buying a camera for their travels now, and most so-called point-and-shoot cameras would now produce worse photos than even a mid-range phone. And while the phones don’t quite measure up to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera\">DSLR</a> quality that is true only in the hands of people who really know what they’re doing and in the eyes of people who know what to look for.</p><p>This is both a hardware and a software change. The lenses and sensors in our phones have improved (and <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/why-are-there-3-cameras-on-the-iphone-11-pro-here-are-the-reasons-for-the-multiple-lenses-18753256\">multiplied</a>) but not nearly as much as the software processing techniques. Aided by improvements in chip design, what is now called ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_photography\">computational photography</a>’ has advanced beyond any expectation we might have had in 2010. This is the one area where the top-of-the-line smartphones most significantly outperform the lower-priced ones. However, even a lower-level mid-range phone now produces better photos and videos than any consumer camera of 2010.</p><p>All of this changed when a camera can be expected to be available and what it makes sense to take pictures of. From the seemingly trivial like taking pictures of one’s food to family pictures. Seeing people looking at the world through the screen of their phone while recording is now commonplace. Combined with the increased availability of data connections and photo-friendly platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp, people share their experiences with each other more visually. It is interesting to imagine what this will mean for the shapes of people’s lives in 20 or 30 years. There are about 20 photos of me between the ages of 1 and 20 that I could still find. My young nieces and nephews generate that many every week, sometimes every day. What will it be like to be able to look back at your entire life so thoroughly documented?</p><p>Let’s not forget one more change this brought. When the decade started, it was still a bit strange seeing people taking photos without <a href=\"https://photographylife.com/how-to-hold-a-camera\">holding a camera to their eye</a>. Camera phones completely changed what we expect a person taking a picture to look like. Even many higher-level dedicated cameras now don’t have a viewfinder and all offer a screen through which it is possible to shoot a photo at arm’s length.</p><h3>Smart speakers</h3><p>When Amazon announced the first <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-echo-and-alexa-the-most-impressive-new-technology-of-2015/\">Amazon Echo in 2015</a>, the tech press was more than sceptical. Who would ever want sometime like this in their house? Who would ever try to use a device where the only way to control it was by voice? These were some of the questions commonly raised about it. But almost nobody who tried it was disappointed and by 2016, when the Echo finally became available in the UK, I bought it immediately without any hesitation. And when Google introduced the <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/google_home\">Home</a> series, I switched to that to integrate all my data. Now I have a smart speaker of some sort in every room of my house — sometimes more. I tell them what music to play for me, to remind me to do things, put things on my shopping or packing list, to set timers, alarms and faders, to turn the lights on and off, and read me the news. More recently, these devices are also available with displays, and the <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/smart-display\">Lenovo Smart Display</a> has truly improved my life by showing me digital photos I’ve taken over the last 15 years.</p><p>Not everybody has or wants one of these devices but Alexa and Siri are now household names, and Ok Google is a common phrase. The idea of speaking to a machine and having it mostly understand what I say that seemed so unrealistic in 2010 is now a reality. And what can be more transformational than that?</p><h3>Smartwatches and fitness trackers</h3><p>Another class of products that transformed what we can expect from the world around us is the fitness tracker. Tracking steps and much more is now a standard part of many people’s lives. The first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitbit\">Fitbit</a> was released in 2009 but it wasn’t until trackers could double as watches and finally watches as trackers that the category became ubiquitous. Apple came late to the party in 2015 with the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/watch/\">Apple Watch</a> but by then I’d already been wearing a smartwatch (first the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch)\">Pebble </a>and then an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_OS\">Android Wear</a> watch) for 2 years. Until 2012 when the Pebble was released, I had not worn anything on my wrist for almost 2 decades. Now, I wear a smartwatch all the time and almost everyone in my family who doesn’t have a smartwatch wears a fitness tracker that tells time, as well. Knowing how active you are is handy, but I find the notifications to be the most useful. Being able to tell time is almost secondary.</p><p>It is true, smartwatches have not lived up to all of their <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/14/apple-watch-series-4-fda-google-wear-os-smartwatch-health/?guccounter=1\">promise</a> and the whole <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearable_technology\">wearable tech</a> category is more than a little anemic but they now have a clear place in the world’s mindshare which earns them a place on this list in my blog.</p><h3>Other smaller hardware trends</h3><p>There are other hardware trends that may not be as prominent but that have still had an impact on the way we live our lives.</p><h4>Touch interfaces</h4><p>The introduction of the iPhone in 2007 ushered a new paradigm for thinking about how to interact by touch. The 2010s have truly brought this new trend to fruition. From the iPad, to touch-supported and 2-in-1 laptops. As capacitive display technology is getting cheaper at larger sizes, we now see more and more displays around us that can be touched with the expectation that they will actually perform the intended action. And most importantly, thanks to the smartphone revolution, gestures on the screen have become part of our inventory of <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/affordances\">affordances</a>.</p><h4>Ubiquitous data / WiFi everywhere</h4><p>Having a WiFi or a fast phone data signal pretty much anywhere in the world has become a reliable expectation. Sure, there are still dead spots, and rural broadband is still an issue in many parts of the world, but gone are the days when you could expect to be truly offline for extended periods of time without some alternative. I travelled through South East Asia in 2016 and even in the middle of Borneo, there was signal of some sort to be had. True, further inland that wasn’t always the case, but being able to buy a cheap SIM card with an affordable data plan truly transformed the experience of travel — for instance, just getting on a local bus and following my journey on Google Maps and thus being able to be more adventurous. And even when mobile data is not available, there is always somewhere with WiFi. It is easy to forget that for much of the 2000s that was not the case. My first 2 laptops did not even have WiFi as standard and now almost no laptop is even shipped with an ethernet port.</p><h4>USB charging</h4><p>Another momentous change of the 2010s is the complete standardisation of powering small electronic devices via USB. So many devices now only come with a USB cable that can be plugged in almost anywhere rather than with a bulky proprietary charger. There is still some variation but (partly thanks to the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2018-6427186/feedback/F18110_en?p_id=342389\">EU directive</a> requiring phone manufacturers to use a standard) things are so much simpler in 2019 than they were in 2009. If only <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging\">wireless charging</a> could now get good enough to make a real difference to deserve a place on this list.</p><h4>Contactless payments</h4><p>There are many innovations to which the initial reaction is ‘How hard is it to do it the old way? Have we really become so lazy that …?’, etc. I remember wondering this about the scroll wheel on the mouse — and now not having one available would make me go insane. I heard many of the same reactions to the introduction of contactless payments. ‘How hard is it to insert a card and type in the pin?’ Not hard. But sometimes removing small friction points has a significant impact. Things got even more seamless with the introduction of <a href=\"https://pay.google.com/about/\">Android Pay</a> (now Google Pay) and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a>. Sure, touching the phone to a terminal is no more laborious than touching a card, but the phone is always more to hand than my wallet. I would never buy a phone that did not support payments.</p><p>The impact of this change on quality of life was underscored during a recent visit to the US where contactless payments are only available sporadically. Of course, I also spent significant amounts of time in the 2010s in countries where even card payments are the exception and my life was not ruined. But contactless payments have certainly changed the way people frame the world. Not too long ago, asking to pay with a phone required an explanation, now holding up a phone at the till is a recognised gesture.</p><h4>Longevity of desktops and laptops</h4><p>I bought my current desktop computer in 2009, since then I’ve added RAM and a bigger faster hard-drive but I have no need or plan to upgrade. It is still more than sufficient for most of my tasks. I bought my previous desktop computer in 2006 and by 2009, it could no longer cope with my needs. My current laptop was bought in 2016 and I foresee it being sufficient for another 2 years. But I have relatives who are still happily using laptops more than 8 years old. The one limiting factor on the lifetime of portable devices is the battery which can only be recharged so many times.</p><p>This is partly because raw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law\">processor speed growth</a> has slowed down but mostly because the demands of software have stopped growing. Prior to Windows 7, every operating system upgrade pretty much required a hardware upgrade, too. But if anything operating system require less power now than before. Professionals in different areas and gamers still want to eke out every bit of performance out of the latest system but even for them the upgrades don’t come as fast as they used to.</p><h4>Drones</h4><p>Aerial photography within reach of anybody? Drones are now <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUR8O-o3A1c\">cheap enough and easy enough to use</a>, that we need to think about how to regulate them. DJI, in particular, has been a leader in this field and their latest <a href=\"https://www.dji.com/mavic-mini\">Mavic Mini</a> is certainly on my wishlist. I don’t have a drone now but boy do I want one. It’s not for everyone but the their use has gone beyond potential.</p><h4>Raspberry Pi, Arduino and others</h4><p>Building your own computer was always niche and expensive. But the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi\">Raspberry Pi</a> introduced in 2012 made it possible to build a computer into anything very cheaply. Add to it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino\">many modular sensor boards</a>, experimenting with hardware became a possibility. This is not a something that would be at the top of a list of popularly transformative changes — but it certainly reshaped the world of the possible for hobbyists.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=15946e2c9cee\" width=\"1\" />"

More recently, these devices are also available with displays, and the <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/smart-display\">Lenovo Smart Display</a> has truly improved my life by showing me digital photos I’ve taken over the last 15 years.</p><p>Not everybody has or wants one of these devices but Alexa and Siri are now household names, and Ok Google is a common phrase. The idea of speaking to a machine and having it mostly understand what I say that seemed so unrealistic in 2010 is now a reality. And what can be more transformational than that?</p><h3>Smartwatches and fitness trackers</h3><p>Another class of products that transformed what we can expect from the world around us is the fitness tracker. Tracking steps and much more is now a standard part of many people’s lives. The first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitbit\">Fitbit</a> was released in 2009 but it wasn’t until trackers could double as watches and finally watches as trackers that the category became ubiquitous. Apple came late to the party in 2015 with the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/watch/\">Apple Watch</a> but by then I’d already been wearing a smartwatch (first the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_(watch)\">Pebble </a>and then an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_OS\">Android Wear</a> watch) for 2 years. Until 2012 when the Pebble was released, I had not worn anything on my wrist for almost 2 decades. Now, I wear a smartwatch all the time and almost everyone in my family who doesn’t have a smartwatch wears a fitness tracker that tells time, as well. Knowing how active you are is handy, but I find the notifications to be the most useful. Being able to tell time is almost secondary.</p><p>It is true, smartwatches have not lived up to all of their <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/14/apple-watch-series-4-fda-google-wear-os-smartwatch-health/?guccounter=1\">promise</a> and the whole <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearable_technology\">wearable tech</a> category is more than a little anemic but they now have a clear place in the world’s mindshare which earns them a place on this list in my blog.</p><h3>Other smaller hardware trends</h3><p>There are other hardware trends that may not be as prominent but that have still had an impact on the way we live our lives.</p><h4>Touch interfaces</h4><p>The introduction of the iPhone in 2007 ushered a new paradigm for thinking about how to interact by touch. The 2010s have truly brought this new trend to fruition. From the iPad, to touch-supported and 2-in-1 laptops. As capacitive display technology is getting cheaper at larger sizes, we now see more and more displays around us that can be touched with the expectation that they will actually perform the intended action. And most importantly, thanks to the smartphone revolution, gestures on the screen have become part of our inventory of <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/affordances\">affordances</a>.</p><h4>Ubiquitous data / WiFi everywhere</h4><p>Having a WiFi or a fast phone data signal pretty much anywhere in the world has become a reliable expectation. Sure, there are still dead spots, and rural broadband is still an issue in many parts of the world, but gone are the days when you could expect to be truly offline for extended periods of time without some alternative. I travelled through South East Asia in 2016 and even in the middle of Borneo, there was signal of some sort to be had. True, further inland that wasn’t always the case, but being able to buy a cheap SIM card with an affordable data plan truly transformed the experience of travel — for instance, just getting on a local bus and following my journey on Google Maps and thus being able to be more adventurous. And even when mobile data is not available, there is always somewhere with WiFi. It is easy to forget that for much of the 2000s that was not the case. My first 2 laptops did not even have WiFi as standard and now almost no laptop is even shipped with an ethernet port.</p><h4>USB charging</h4><p>Another momentous change of the 2010s is the complete standardisation of powering small electronic devices via USB. So many devices now only come with a USB cable that can be plugged in almost anywhere rather than with a bulky proprietary charger. There is still some variation but (partly thanks to the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2018-6427186/feedback/F18110_en?p_id=342389\">EU directive</a> requiring phone manufacturers to use a standard) things are so much simpler in 2019 than they were in 2009. If only <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging\">wireless charging</a> could now get good enough to make a real difference to deserve a place on this list.</p><h4>Contactless payments</h4><p>There are many innovations to which the initial reaction is ‘How hard is it to do it the old way? Have we really become so lazy that …?’, etc. I remember wondering this about the scroll wheel on the mouse — and now not having one available would make me go insane. I heard many of the same reactions to the introduction of contactless payments. ‘How hard is it to insert a card and type in the pin?’ Not hard. But sometimes removing small friction points has a significant impact. Things got even more seamless with the introduction of <a href=\"https://pay.google.com/about/\">Android Pay</a> (now Google Pay) and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a>. Sure, touching the phone to a terminal is no more laborious than touching a card, but the phone is always more to hand than my wallet. I would never buy a phone that did not support payments.</p><p>The impact of this change on quality of life was underscored during a recent visit to the US where contactless payments are only available sporadically. Of course, I also spent significant amounts of time in the 2010s in countries where even card payments are the exception and my life was not ruined. But contactless payments have certainly changed the way people frame the world. Not too long ago, asking to pay with a phone required an explanation, now holding up a phone at the till is a recognised gesture.</p><h4>Longevity of desktops and laptops</h4><p>I bought my current desktop computer in 2009, since then I’ve added RAM and a bigger faster hard-drive but I have no need or plan to upgrade. It is still more than sufficient for most of my tasks. I bought my previous desktop computer in 2006 and by 2009, it could no longer cope with my needs. My current laptop was bought in 2016 and I foresee it being sufficient for another 2 years. But I have relatives who are still happily using laptops more than 8 years old. The one limiting factor on the lifetime of portable devices is the battery which can only be recharged so many times.</p><p>This is partly because raw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law\">processor speed growth</a> has slowed down but mostly because the demands of software have stopped growing. Prior to Windows 7, every operating system upgrade pretty much required a hardware upgrade, too. But if anything operating system require less power now than before. Professionals in different areas and gamers still want to eke out every bit of performance out of the latest system but even for them the upgrades don’t come as fast as they used to.</p><h4>Drones</h4><p>Aerial photography within reach of anybody? Drones are now <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUR8O-o3A1c\">cheap enough and easy enough to use</a>, that we need to think about how to regulate them. DJI, in particular, has been a leader in this field and their latest <a href=\"https://www.dji.com/mavic-mini\">Mavic Mini</a> is certainly on my wishlist. I don’t have a drone now but boy do I want one. It’s not for everyone but the their use has gone beyond potential.</p><h4>Raspberry Pi, Arduino and others</h4><p>Building your own computer was always niche and expensive. But the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi\">Raspberry Pi</a> introduced in 2012 made it possible to build a computer into anything very cheaply. Add to it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino\">many modular sensor boards</a>, experimenting with hardware became a possibility. This is not a something that would be at the top of a list of popularly transformative changes — but it certainly reshaped the world of the possible for hobbyists.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=15946e2c9cee\" width=\"1\" />"
