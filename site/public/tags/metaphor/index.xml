This gives the impression that metaphors are there to explain more abstract concepts in terms of more concrete ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My immediate reaction was that they are not alike because machine learning is really a misnomer. Or rather machine learning has some aspects of learning but is dissimilar from prototypical learning in enough ways to make the analogy dangerous. But my second thought was that actually organizational learning and prototypical learning are dissimilar in the same ways that machine learning and prototypical learning are. We could then learn more about both if we look at the various mappings and mismappings (a sort of metaphor hack).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But they ain’t. Be warned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-197-doug-hubbard-on-why-people-think-some-things-cant-be.html&#34;&gt;Rationally Speaking&lt;/a&gt; podcast Julia Galef and Doug Hubbard discussed the notion of ‘How to Measure Anything’. This is not a screed against daring to assign numerical values. I think we need to start from the premise that everything that Juia and Doug said is correct. However, I want to show that even with that premise, the intuitive objections to assigning numerical values to human values are still necessary. And in fact, if we object on these grounds, we can see that in fact we can measure nothing while we can still benefit from using tools of measurement to think about complex problems. But these tools are metaphors about those problems — they are not describing some hidden true essence — they are giving us a way of thinking about them. And as with any metaphors, we need to reject them as often as take them for our own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Repaved paths and generative metaphors: Expressing human purposes with technology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an edited version of my side of a discussion on an education technology mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I fully subscribe to the idea of thinking about pedagogy as being a type of technology (so are cultural institutions according to anthropologists and many people even think of language that way). But most people think of technology as ‘digital technology’ which is how ‘education technology’ is used. For them technology is a real or virtual machine that performs tasks independent of human intervention or in response to basic human actions. What I find most useful is switching between the two perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
