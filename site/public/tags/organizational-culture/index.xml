My immediate reaction was that they are not alike because machine learning is really a misnomer. Or rather machine learning has some aspects of learning but is dissimilar from prototypical learning in enough ways to make the analogy dangerous. But my second thought was that actually organizational learning and prototypical learning are dissimilar in the same ways that machine learning and prototypical learning are. We could then learn more about both if we look at the various mappings and mismappings (a sort of metaphor hack).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
