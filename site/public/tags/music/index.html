        <p><p>People often talk about music as if it were language. Leonard Bernstein even recorded a series of lectures applying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB7ZOdp__gQ">Chomsky’s theory of generative grammar to music</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kojvij-PNq8">Chomsky himself</a> answered a question on this in a not very satisfying manner. Some people can get very exercised over this.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that a playing around with strengths and weakness of the music = language metaphor can help us come to grips with the question a bit better. We can find a number of mappings between music and language but an equal number of mis-mappings. We do not need to go very far into it to see where they are. That does not mean that a deeper investigation into musical properties of language and linguistic properties of music cannot be fruitful. And obviously they are both universal human faculties — but looking for a musical essence in language or a linguistic essence in music is what a metaphor aware approach to this question is hoping to warn against.</p></p>
