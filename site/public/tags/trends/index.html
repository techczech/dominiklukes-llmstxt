<p>When Samsung introduced the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Note_series">Galaxy Note in 2011</a>, everybody thought they were crazy because the 5.3 inch screen looked massive. People even felt the need to invent a new term for this, a ‘phablet’. When I saw friend hold her Note to her ear, it looked so strange I had to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Lq3SqpxKpQ/">take a picture</a>. When I look at it now, it looks perfectly normal.</p></p>

<h3 id="dropbox-and-cloud-storage-andsync">Dropbox and cloud storage and sync</h3>
<p>For me, the first decade of the century was characterised by the USB stick. I always carried a few with me, usually around my neck. The USB drive replaced the previously ubiquitous floppy disk which was the data-transfer medium of the 1990s (even if they lost their floppiness). And while USB sticks are still extremely common and useful, they have been replaced in my life by cloud storage.</p></p>
