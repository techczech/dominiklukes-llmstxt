title: 'Comedian identifies a critical flaw in structuralism: Are distinctive features
  like leather sleeves'

I always thought this little bit by [Demetri Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetri_Martin "Demetri Martin") highlights a crucial deficiency in any distinctive feature analysis.

> Demetri Martin: “I was at a party, and I saw a guy with a leather jacket, and I thought, ‘That’s cool’. Then I saw a guy with a leather vest and I thought, ‘That’s not cool’. It was then that I realized what coolness is all about… leather sleeves.”

Is phonology all about leather sleeves?
