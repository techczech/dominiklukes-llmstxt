        <p><h2 id="what-is-acwrimo">What is #AcWriMo</h2>
<p>November is the month of writing. There’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month">NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month)</a> for writing fiction but also <a href="http://www.phd2published.com/acwri-2/acbowrimo/about/">AcWriMo (Academic Writing Month)</a> for producing academic writing. The idea behind NaNoWriMo is to make a commitment and finish a piece of writing. This makes more sense for fiction because everyone has that novel inside them and having a month to have a go all out at it is a sensible thing. You may not finish but by the end of the month, you will probably know if you have what it takes.</p></p>

<p>This post has two independent parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>I ask what would some of the <strong>basic criteria for sentience</strong> be and how to check for them in a way that would give us a chance to satisfy our need to know.</li>
<li>I explore some of the <strong>dilemmas a fully machine-based sentient entity would have to face</strong> or rather paradoxes we would have to address.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are four things, I think it’s worth checking for, each with a relatively simple question or task. They are:</p></p>

        <p><h1 id="how-to-read-this">How to read this</h1>
<ul>
<li>This will take about <strong>18 minutes to read</strong> (at <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/13/most-comprehensive-review-to-date-suggests-the-average-persons-reading-speed-is-slower-than-commonly-thought/">230 words/min</a>) but the text is structured to make it easy to <strong>jump around</strong> and find the key points faster. I tend to go into more detail than most people find necessary.</li>
<li>Two <strong>reasons to read</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore a different perspective</strong> on some aspects of teaching and learning</li>
<li><strong>See an illustration</strong> of a generative metaphor analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>two main sections</strong> can be read independently
<ul>
<li>Metaphor breakdown (12 mins)
<ul>
<li>Includes a table summarising key comparisons, this can be read instead of the detailed breakdown</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overall lessons (5 mins)
<ul>
<li>Includes an aside on two modes of education (2 mins) that can be skipped</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are also <strong>paragraphs on</strong> (they are not necessary to understand the main point):
<ul>
<li>method of metaphor analysis (1 min) and</li>
<li>usefulness of metaphor for learning (1 min)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This can be read <strong>in sequence or in parts</strong> – the order matters but you can circle around</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This was <strong>initially written</strong> as part of a discussion about how to best organise learning support but it got out of hand. It should be comprehensible on its own.</p></p>

        <p><h2 id="how-hard-is-it-to-translate-metaphor">How hard is it to translate metaphor?</h2>
<p>Metaphor seems like it should be very difficult to translate. But I’d like to argue that what is difficult about translating it is not the metaphor part but rather how it is used. This makes it no different from any other aspect of language. But because it is a rather salient use of language, we can use it to illustrate these general problems of translation.</p></p>
