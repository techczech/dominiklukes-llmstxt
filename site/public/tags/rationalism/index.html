<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<ol>
<li>Lots of people say things like ‘religion causes war’</li>
<li>But looking at a list of wars shows that relatively few are ‘caused’ by religion</li>
<li>Religion does not stop wars and is often used to bolster the case — but it is rarely the primary causal agent</li>
<li>What causes wars is: 1) <strong>Guns:</strong> Availability of means to wage war (not literally guns) 2) <strong>Glory:</strong> A framework within which the war makes sense (makes people feel good about fighting it) 3) <strong>Greed:</strong> A desire for resources</li>
<li>But all of this is even more complicated because neither <em>war</em> not <em>religion</em> are straightforward concepts that can be easily entered into some sort of causality identification algorithm.</li>
</ol>

<p>I wrote this about 2 years ago but I felt it needed more thought. Now, that I’ve reread it with some distance, I find that I have very little to add. I have found a few new things (for instance about the religious discourse around many of the Persian wars) but nothing that would make me alter the basic outline. So, here it goes.</p></p>
