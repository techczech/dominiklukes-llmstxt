        <h2 id="i-am-a-gaming-semi-literate">I am a gaming semi-literate!</h2>
<p>I was listening to the discussion of the latest BioShock game on <a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-tech/399">the latest TWiT podcast</a> when I realized that I am in fact game illiterate. I am hearing these stories and descriptions of experiences but I know I can’t access them directly without a major investment in knowledge and skill acquisition. So, this is what people with no or limited literacy must feel like in highly literacy-dependent environments. I really want to access the stories in the way they are told by the game. But I know I can’t. I will stumble, be discouraged, not have a very good time before I can have a good time. I will be a struggling gamer, in the same way that there are struggling readers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When I say game, I mean mostly a non-casual computer game such as BioShock or War of Worldcraft or SimCity.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-a-game-literacy-entail">What would a game literacy entail?</h2>
<p>What would I need to learn in order to access gaming? Literacy is composed of a multiplicity of knowledge areas and skills. I already have some of these but not enough. Roughly, I will need to get at the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Underlying cognitive skills</em> (<strong>For reading:</strong> transforming the sight of letters into sounds or corresponding mental representations. <strong>For gaming:</strong> transforming desired effects on screen into actions on a controller)</li>
<li><em>Complex perceptual and productive fluency</em> (Ability to employ the cognitive skills automatically in response to changing stimuli in multiple contexts).</li>
<li><em>Context-based or task-based strategies</em> (Ability to direct the underlying skills towards solving particular problems in particular contexts. <strong>For reading:</strong> Skim text, or look things up in the index, or skip acknowledgements, discover the type of text, or adopt reading speed appropriate to type of text, etc. <strong>For gaming</strong> Discover the type of game, or gather appropriate achievements, or find hidden bonuses, etc.)</li>
<li><em>Metacognitive skills and strategies</em> (Learn the terminology and concepts necessary for further learning and to achieve the appropopriate aims using stratgies.)</li>
<li><em>Socialization skills and strategies</em> (Learn to use the skills and knowledge to make connections with other people and exploit those connections to acquire further skill, knowledge as well as social capital derriving from those)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-literacy-a-suitable-metaphor-for-gaming-matches-and-mismatches">Is literacy a suitable metaphor for gaming? Matches and mismatches!</h2>
<p>With any metaphor it is worth to explore the mapping to see if there are sufficient similarities. In this case, I’ll look at the following areas for matches and mismatches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skill</li>
<li>Mode</li>
<li>Status</li>
<li>Socialization</li>
<li>Content</li>
<li>Purpose</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="skill">Skill</h3>
<p>Both reading/writing (I will continue to use reading for both unless I need to stress the difference) and gaming require skill that can become automatic and that takes time to acquire. People can be both “better” and “worse” at gaming and reading.</p>
<p>But reading is a more universal skill (although not as universal as most people think) whereas gaming skills are more genre based.</p>
<p>The skill at gaming can be more easily measured by game achievement. Quality of reading measures are a bit more tenuous because speed, fluency and accuracy are all contextual measures. However, even game achievement is a bit more relative, such as in recommendations to play at normal or easy to experience the game.</p>
<p>In this gaming is more like reading than for instance, listening to music or watching a skill which do not require any overt acquisition of skill. See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKIiUsbOO24">Dara O’Briain’s funny bit on the differences between gaming and reading</a>. Of course, when he says “you cannot be bad at watching a film”, we could quibble that much preparation is required for watching some films, but such training does not involve the development of underlying cognitive skills (assuming the same cultural and linguistic environment). Things are a bit more complex for some special kind of listening to music. Nevertheless people do talk about “media literacy”.</p>
<h3 id="mode">Mode</h3>
<p>Reading is mostly a uni-modal experience. It is possible to read out loud or to read while listening but ultimately reading is its own mode. Reading has an equivalent in writing that though not a mirror image skill, requires relatively the same skill.</p>
<p>Gaming is a profoundly multimodal experience combining vision, sound, movement (and often reading, as well). There are even efforts to involve smell. Gaming does not have a clear expressive counterpart. The obvious expressive equivalent to writing would be game design but that clearly requires a different level of skill. However, gaming allows complex levels of self-expression within the process of game play which does not have an equivalent in reading but is not completely dissimilar to creative writing (like fanfiction).</p>
<h3 id="status">Status</h3>
<p>Reading is a neutral to high status activity. The act itself is neutral but status can derrive from content. Writing (expressive rather than utilitarian) is a high status activity.</p>
<p>Gaming is a low status to neutral activity. No loss of status derives from inability to game to not gaming in a way that is true of reading. Some games have less questionable status and many games are played by people who derive high status from outside of gaming. There are emerging status sanction systems around gaming but none have penetrated outside gaming, yet.</p>
<h3 id="socialization">Socialization</h3>
<p>Reading and writing are significant drivers of wider socialization. They are necessary to perform basic social functions and often represent gateways into important social contexts.</p>
<p>Gaming is only required to socialize in gaming groups. However, this socialization may become more highly desirable over time.</p>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>Writing is used to encode a wide variety of content – from shopping lists to neuclear plant manuals to fiction.</p>
<p>Games on the other hand, encode a much more narrower range of content. Primarily narrative and primarily finctional. Although more non-narrative and non-fictional games may exist. There are also expository games but so far, none that would afford easy storage of non-game information without using writing.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>Reading and writing are very general purpose activities.</p>
<p>Gaming on the other hand has a limited range of purposes: enjoyment, learning, socialization with friends, achieving status in a wider community. You won’t see a bus stop with a game instead of a timetable (although some of these require puzzle solving skills to decipher).</p>
<h2 id="why-may-game-literacy-be-important">Why may game literacy be important?</h2>
<p>As we saw, there are many differences between gaming and reading and writing. Nevertheless, they are similar enough that the metaphor of ‘game literacy’ makes sense provided we see its limitations.</p>
<p>Why is it important? There will be a growing generational and populational divide of gamers and non-gamers. At the moment this is not very important in terms of opportunities and status but it could easily change within a generation.</p>
<p>Not being able to play a game may exclude people from social groups in the same way that not-playing golf or not engaging in some other locally sanctioned pursuit does (e.g. World of Warcraft).</p>
<p>But most importantly, as new generations of game creators explore the expressive boundaries of games (new narratives, new ways of story telling), not being able to play games may result in significant social exclusion. In the same way that a quick summary of what’s in a novel is inferior to reading the novel, films based on games will be pale imitations of playing the games.</p>
<p>I can easily imagine a future where the major narratives of the day will be expressed in games. In the same way that TV serials have supplanted novels as the primary medium of sharing crucial societal narratives, games can take over in the future. The inner life novel took about 150 years to mature and reigned supreme for about as long while drama and film functioned as its accompaniment. The TV serial is now solidifying its position and is about where the novel was in the 1850s. Gaming may take another couple of decades to get to a stage where it is ready as a format to take over. And maybe nothing like that will happen. But if I had a child, I’d certainly encourage them to play computer games as part of ensuring a more secure future.</p>
