      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an edited version of my side of a discussion on an education technology mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I fully subscribe to the idea of thinking about pedagogy as being a type of technology (so are cultural institutions according to anthropologists and many people even think of language that way). But most people think of technology as ‘digital technology’ which is how ‘education technology’ is used. For them technology is a real or virtual machine that performs tasks independent of human intervention or in response to basic human actions. What I find most useful is switching between the two perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
