<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<ol>
<li>Lots of people say things like ‘religion causes war’</li>
<li>But looking at a list of wars shows that relatively few are ‘caused’ by religion</li>
<li>Religion does not stop wars and is often used to bolster the case — but it is rarely the primary causal agent</li>
<li>What causes wars is: 1) <strong>Guns:</strong> Availability of means to wage war (not literally guns) 2) <strong>Glory:</strong> A framework within which the war makes sense (makes people feel good about fighting it) 3) <strong>Greed:</strong> A desire for resources</li>
<li>But all of this is even more complicated because neither <em>war</em> not <em>religion</em> are straightforward concepts that can be easily entered into some sort of causality identification algorithm.</li>
</ol>

<p>I wrote this about 2 years ago but I felt it needed more thought. Now, that I’ve reread it with some distance, I find that I have very little to add. I have found a few new things (for instance about the religious discourse around many of the Persian wars) but nothing that would make me alter the basic outline. So, here it goes.</p></p>

<h3 id="outline-of-theargument">Outline of the argument</h3>
<p>History of often accused of not being sufficiently scientific. To remedy this people try to come up with all sorts of theories of history that try to look like science. They come up with some measurable variable (e.g. availability of domesticable species as Jared Diamond did or energy output as Ian Morris did or size of population, advancement of technology, size of armies, etc. as many others do). This, they hope, explains the past and predicts the future. Based on the theories, the would-be-scientist-historians build models that seem to make perfect sense but seemingly fall apart when overtaken by events. This makes history seem like it’s not at all scientific. But that’s only because we’re comparing it to the very rare instances in science where long-term perfect prediction is possible. Like the motions of planetary bodies or the behavior of a computer. But in most cases, science struggles with perfect prediction. In medicine, it’s impossible to predict the exact course a disease will take in any one individual, even though it is often possible to predict what course it will take over a thousand individuals. In biology, it is impossible to predict, which features will be selected over others through natural selection. But it is possible to predict that some will be. But the best analogy, to my mind, is the weather.</p></p>
