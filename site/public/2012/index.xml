      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of this post was incorporated into an article I wrote with Brian Kelly and Alistair McNaught that appeared in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue70/kelly-et-al&#34;&gt;the December issue of Ariadne&lt;/a&gt;. As part of that work and feedback from Alistair and Brian, I expanded the final section from a simple list of bullets into a more detailed research programme. You can see it below and in the article.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-from-spelling-reform-to-plain-language&#34;&gt;Background: From spelling reform to plain language&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/12836528@N00/4843655940&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/4843655940_a8479f5c4d_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Simple&#34; title=&#34;Simple&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Every language act we are a part of is an act of categorization. There are no simple unitary terms in language. When I say, “pull up a chair”, I’m in fact referring to a vast category of objects we refer to as chairs. These objects are not identified by any one set of features like four legs, certain height, certain ways of using it. There is no minimal set of features that will describe all chairs and just chairs and not other kinds of objects like tables or pillows. But chairs don’t stand on their own. They are related to other concepts or categories (and they are really one and the same). There are subcategories like stools and armchairs, containing categories like furniture or man-made objects and related categories like houses and shops selling objects. All of these categories are linked in our minds through a complex set of images, stories and definitions. But these don’t just live in our minds. They also appear in our conversations. So we say things like, “What kind of a chair would you like to buy?”, “That’s not real chair”, “What’s the point of a chair if you can’t sit in it?”, “Stools are not chairs.”, “It’s more of a couch than a chair.”, “Sofas are really just big plush chairs, when it comes down to it.”, “I’m using a box for a chair.”, “Don’t sit on a table, it’s not a chair.” Etc. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_being&#34; title=&#34;Category of being&#34;&gt;Categories&lt;/a&gt; are not stable and uniform across all people, so we continue having conversations about them. There are experts on chairs, historians of chairs, chair craftsmen, people who buy chairs for a living, people who study the word ‘chair’, and people who casually use chairs. Some more than others. And their sets of stories and images and definitions related to chairs will be slightly different. And they will have had different types of conversations with different people about chairs. All of that goes into a simple word like “chair”. It’s really very simple as long as we accept the complexity for what it is. Philosophers of language have made a right mess of things because they tried to find simplicity where none exists. And what’s more where none is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pseudo-education as a weapon: Beyond the ridiculous in linguistic prescriptivism</title>

One such phrase is “knowledge is power”. It is used to refer not just to education, of course, but to all sorts of intelligence gathering from business to politics. We tell many stories of how knowing something made the difference, from knowing a way of making something to work to knowing a secret only the hero or villain is privy to. But in education, in particular, it is not just knowing that matters to our tribe but also the display of knowing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Character Assasination through Metaphoric Pomposity: When one metaphor is not enough</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;George Lakoff is known for saying that “metaphors can kill” and he’s not wrong. But in that, metaphors are no different from any other language. The simple amoral imperative “Kill!” will do the job just as nicely. Nor are metaphors any better or worse at obfuscating than any other type of language. But they are very good at their primary purpose which is making complex connections between domains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Metaphors can create very powerful connections where none existed before. And we are just as often seduced by that power as inspired to new heights of creativity. We don’t really have a choice. Metaphoric thinking is in our DNA (itself a metaphor). But just like with DNA, context is important, and sometimes metaphors work for us and sometimes they work against us. The more powerful they are, the more cautious we need to be. When faced with powerful metaphors we should always look for alternatives and we should also explore the limits of the metaphors and the connections they make. We need to keep in mind that nothing IS anything else but everything is LIKE something else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
