<h3 id="note">Note:</h3>
<p>These were supposed to be quick notes. But they ain’t. Be warned.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>In a recent <a href="http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-197-doug-hubbard-on-why-people-think-some-things-cant-be.html">Rationally Speaking</a> podcast Julia Galef and Doug Hubbard discussed the notion of ‘How to Measure Anything’. This is not a screed against daring to assign numerical values. I think we need to start from the premise that everything that Juia and Doug said is correct. However, I want to show that even with that premise, the intuitive objections to assigning numerical values to human values are still necessary. And in fact, if we object on these grounds, we can see that in fact we can measure nothing while we can still benefit from using tools of measurement to think about complex problems. But these tools are metaphors about those problems — they are not describing some hidden true essence — they are giving us a way of thinking about them. And as with any metaphors, we need to reject them as often as take them for our own.</p></p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<ol>
<li>Lots of people say things like ‘religion causes war’</li>
<li>But looking at a list of wars shows that relatively few are ‘caused’ by religion</li>
<li>Religion does not stop wars and is often used to bolster the case — but it is rarely the primary causal agent</li>
<li>What causes wars is: 1) <strong>Guns:</strong> Availability of means to wage war (not literally guns) 2) <strong>Glory:</strong> A framework within which the war makes sense (makes people feel good about fighting it) 3) <strong>Greed:</strong> A desire for resources</li>
<li>But all of this is even more complicated because neither <em>war</em> not <em>religion</em> are straightforward concepts that can be easily entered into some sort of causality identification algorithm.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="historical-note">Historical Note</h3>
<p>I wrote this about 2 years ago but I felt it needed more thought. Now, that I’ve reread it with some distance, I find that I have very little to add. I have found a few new things (for instance about the religious discourse around many of the Persian wars) but nothing that would make me alter the basic outline. So, here it goes.</p></p>
