<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>In this post, I dissect two key modes of sense-making: narrative and ruminative:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrative Sense-Making</strong>
<ul>
<li>The narrative mode, often our default due to its vivid place in our experiences, unfolds in a linear, guided fashion, much like a predator hunting its prey.</li>
<li>However, I argue that its reliance on human experience can become a limitation, especially when it cannot draw on pre-existing knowledge. In a way, it narratives are parasitic on our experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ruminative Sense-Making</strong>
<ul>
<li>As a counterpoint, I introduce the ruminative mode, drawing inspiration from the grazing and digestion habits of ruminant animals.</li>
<li>This mode encourages us to revisit and ponder over information in a non-linear, iterative manner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Practical Examples</strong>
<ul>
<li>To illustrate this ruminative mode, I present the examples of economist Tyler Cowen and quantum computing researcher Michael Nielsen.</li>
<li>Both these thinkers read in clusters, revisit content, and integrate new insights into their pre-existing knowledge base.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Drawing from these insights, I propose a balanced approach incorporating both modes:</p></p>
