        <p>I was reminded by <a href="http://thelousylinguist.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/the-birth-of-metaphor.html">this blog post on LousyLinguist</a> that many people still see metaphor as an unproblematic homogeneous concept leading to much circular thinking about them.  I wrote about that quite a few years ago in:</p>
<p>Lukeš, D., 2005. Towards a classification of metaphor use in text: Issues in conceptual discourse analysis of a domain-specific corpus. In <em>Third Workshop on Corpus-Based Approaches to Figurative Language</em>. Birmingham.</p>
<p>I suggested that a classification of metaphor had better focused on their use rather than inherent nature. I came up with the heuristic device of: cognitive, social and textual uses of metaphor.</p>
<p>Some of the uses I came up with (inspired by the literature from Halliday to Lakoff) were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cognitive
<ul>
<li>Conceptual (constitutive)</li>
<li>Attributive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social (Interpersonal)
<ul>
<li>Conceptual/Declarative (informational)</li>
<li>Figurative (elegant variation)</li>
<li>Innovative</li>
<li>Exegetic</li>
<li>Prevaricative</li>
<li>Performative</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Textual
<ul>
<li>Cohesive (anaphoric, cataphoric, exophoric)</li>
<li>Coherent</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also posited a continuum of salience and recoverability in metaphors:</p>
<ul>
<li>High salience and recoverability</li>
<li>Low salience and recoverability</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the <strong><a href="http://metaphorhacker.techczech.net/files/2013/04/Luke%C5%A1-2005-Towards-a-classification-of-metaphor-use-in-text-.pdf">entire paper here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>My thinking on metaphor has moved on since then – I see it as a special case of framing and conceptual integration rather than a sui generis concept – but I still find this a useful guide to return to when confronted with metaphor use.</p>
